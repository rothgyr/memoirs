[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Last letterFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 4 May 2009 13:57:42 +0000Dear family,    I don’t think it’s sunk in yet that I’m leaving.  This last week in some of the quieter hours, I’ve spent a lot of time pondering my mission- my successes, my faults, my high times and my low times.  I had fewer baptisms than I would have liked to have, but as I pondered, I realized; if every person that I taught and got an answer had been baptized, perhaps I could have baptized hundreds of people.  In fact, I do not doubt it.  I have seen hundreds of people feel the power of the spirit as I taught.  They knew it was true, for no one can deny the whisperings of the Holy Spirit.  Perhaps I wasted unnecessary time working with them and waiting for them to progress while they did not keep their commitments that lead to baptism.     This last week we had the Zone leader Counsel in Florianopolis.  I received several honors and was glad to know that Pres Queiroz thinks well of me.  President asked me to say the closing prayer, which he usually reserves for himself to bless us.  I shall miss dearly being a missionary, especially of our mission.  I feel that I have done well as a missionary.   When I arrived in the mission, Pres. Dansie requested that we write our own testimony of the living Christ, and prepare it throughout our missions to give to him at the end.  He is not here, but I will give you my testimony of the Savior Jesus Christ.Jesus Christ was chosen before this earth was created to be our savior and redeemer. He is the god of the Old Testament and the great I AM; Jehovah. All things exist by the grace of His glory. He is the Light and the Life of the world, a light that is endless, that never can be darkened; a light that gives life to all creatures in existence. He took upon Himself flesh and blood and walked among us, even the light which illumines our lives, yet he was rejected, for even as I have seen and bear witness, men loved darkness and reject the light.  He walked among us and grew grace for every grace, light upon light until He received a fullness of the Glory of the Father, and was and is One with the Father. He was pure, clean from all sin, and was worthy to fulfill His mission and bring to pass the eternal life and immortality of mankind by means of making atonement with us His brethren, and our very Eternal Father. It was He who created the earth and filled it with light. He was chosen from the beginning to overcome the natural effects of the fall and allow us, His brethren, to be redeemed from physical death through resurrection, and spiritual death on conditions of following His Gospel of having Faith on His name, Repentance, Baptism, Baptism by the receipt of the gift of the Holy Ghost and abiding in accordance with all other ordinances of His Gospel.  And as we abide by our promises made in our covenant, we are purified, with the promise of being sanctified and made perfect in Him.  He is the God of the Old Testament, the Hope of Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel.He was born to Mary, a virgin, and is the very Son of God in the flesh. He was born of humble circumstances and gave the perfect example of service and righteousness, walking before His Father with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind, yet He never ceded to sin. Being thus pure He qualified Himself to make Himself an offering for sin.In the Garden of Gethsemane, He suffered for our sins, making possible a remission of our sins. He took upon Him the pains and hurt of all men that have ever lived and have yet to live, that He might know how to succor them in their need, and bind up the broken hearted. These things I know, for I myself have felt His power to purify of sin, His matchless peace that comes to those who suffer, and I testify that this power is very, very real.  I know, and put forth my witness that in our darkest hours when all is seemingly lost and our hearts cry out for sympathy and justice, when our hearts cry, “is there no balm to my broken soul?!”; I know that the comfort of the loving arms of Him who suffers with us comes to bind up the broken hearted for he took upon Himself our pains in the garden of Gethsemane that He might know how to succor us in our need.After suffering in Gethsemane, He was imprisoned, judged unlawfully and delivered up to be given an ignominious and horrible death. Crucifixion, the death consigned to thieves and assassins was decreed on the only human being to walk blamelessly on this earth, even the creator of this world, and there, on Calvary, he poured out His whole soul unto death. His great heart literally broke for sorrow of the sins of His people. ‘Behold the wounds in His hands His feet, the Blood and tears both mingled down. Did ere such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown?’After three days in the sepulcher, Jesus Christ, the Anointed One resurrected to life and immortality. I testify, with the energy of my living soul, that He does, indeed, live. And by so living, all men shall live again, raised from corruption to incorruption, from death to endless life, then to be judged by the very being that suffered their cause. As a resurrected being, He still lives, He still loves and He still speaks. After the long darkness of apostasy and absence of His holy Priesthood and men called after His holy order, He and our Eternal Father appeared to Joseph Smith and called him to be an Elias or restorer of the fullness of the Gospel. Jesus Christ has spoken again and sent forth angels to teach men the Plan of Salvation and ordain men to His Holy Order to teach these things to the rest of the children of men. I have been called to this Order, and having received an holy calling and ordinance, I testify, in the very name of Jesus Christ, that He Does live. All men can grow in His holy light through repentance and holy works, and see that light grow brighter and brighter until the perfect day. As I ponder His amazing sacrifice, I am want to sing the words; “Love so amazing, so divine demands my heart, my life, my all.” This is my testimony, This is my life, my force, my Hope and my dream, and I know that in accordance with my works in the flesh and my strivings in the spirit one day I too shall receive my body again, this time in absolute perfection there to be crowned with glory, immortality and eternal life- by the side of my dearest loved ones- never more to depart out of the arms of my Savior, my Captain, King and Dearest Friend, for it is By His power that it is done.And now I lift my voice to all souls to whom may read; I know that Jesus is the Christ the Holy Son of the Living God.  Come unto Him.  Come unto Him and receive the joy that was prepared for you since the foundation of the world!  I would that all men might come unto Him and feel as I feel, Know as I know and Hope as I hope.  That all that read may find the grace of this Jesus and reach His peace and salvation is my prayer, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ. AMENJoseph Levi AndrewsI love you all and am I look forward to seeing you on Friday. Love, Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Epistle to the Andrews familyFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 27 Apr 2009 14:21:18 +0000Dear Family,This week we had Zone Conference and interviews, and I learned a lot.  I got letters from Rebecca and Jason, Elder Paul Woodbury, President Ross and a recent convert that we baptized in Itajai.  Thank you for your inspiring and hope filled letters.  I am Excited to work and will not desist until the end.  This week we discussed the state of our branch here and we decided that we would make a covenant with the Lord to baptize a new branch president and other leaders until 17 of June.  Our lunch messages are also being revamped and we are trying to help the members know what they can do to repent and be worthy to receive the blessings of a branch presidency.    My testimony of the Priesthood grows ever stronger.  We gave a blessing to a little girl with a fever that wasn’t supposed to go away for another three or four days and the next day we saw her playing and active, completely cured.  Her parents accepted the message of the restoration but unfortunately are only passing through the city on vacation and will return to Sao Paulo this week.  This week we went and climbed Morro da Cruz (Cross Hill) and prayed to consecrate our covenant and area for the work we are doing.  The Spirit was strong and we feel Heavens aid with us.  I love to be a missionary and work with all my might mind heart and strength.  The Lord is our strength, the one true rock of our salvation, and those who do all to build themselves in the restored gospel will never, ever fall.  I know it with all that I am. I just got my travel Itinerary and I will be back next Friday at more or less 9:15 AM.  I will be in the Dallas airport for an hour for a layover.  It feels weird to know that I will be home again.  It seems like yesterday that I left.  I remember getting on the plane in KC and looking out the window at the city going away.  I thought to myself; “Joseph you idiot, why did you say that you thought you would do will in learning another language?”  I was going to a strange place, with a strange people who speak a strange language.  None of my knowledge would be of any use if I didn’t know how to express it.  Now its all so normal.  I want you to know that I love you all and pray for you.  Thank you for all the support and love that you have shown me throughout my life.  I love you and thank you.             Love, Elder Andrews

Thank you for answering my questions that I had and making things clear.  I am Excited to work and will not desist until the end.  This week we discussed the state of our branch here and we decided that we would make a covenant with the Lord to baptize a new branch president and other leaders until 17 of June.  Our lunch messages are also being revamped and we are trying to help the members know what they can do to repent and be worthy to receive the blessings of a branch presidency.  Elder M Pereira is doing fine and I like working with him and will do my best to help him prepare for being senior.    This week we dropped a few investigators who never go to church no matter how many times they tell you they will.  It is sometimes difficult, both for us and for them.  We went to a house where live several recent convert girls who haven’t been to church in a while and it turns out that there father isn’t letting them go anymore.  He says that they are getting uppity and telling him that he shouldn’t drink, smoke, beat them, or do drugs anymore.  So he said that he doesn’t have a problem with any religion and he’ll let his girls go if he thinks its the right religion.  He was drinking the whole time and was jumping from excuse to excuse.  So I told him the way it is.  I asked him what he would do if the Savior appeared to him and said he was decepcionado with him.  He said he would change.  So I told him that the Savior WAS decepcionado with him and wanted him to repent.  I told him what he could do to repent and have peace and happiness in his life and it all started with letting his daughters go to church.  I bore my testimony with all the energy I had and told him he could repent and still have happiness.  I told him only the Gospel of Jesus Christ could heal his torn family.  He was crying the whole time, but in the end he wouldn’t let his daughters go.  I left sorrowing for the girls and what lies ahead for them.  I pray for them to have the strength and the courage to continue.  I said a lot of things to him, gave promises if he did what was right, and a caution of what would happen if he didn’t.  Afterwards I was in doubt if I had done the right thing in speaking in the way I did.  I asked my companion if he could feel the Holy Ghost when I was speaking and he said yes.  That made glad.  If the Spirit is felt, that’s what counts.     My testimony of the Priesthood grows ever stronger.  We gave a blessing to a little girl with a fever that wasn’t supposed to go away for another three or four days and the next day we saw her playing and active, completely cured.  Her parents accepted the message of the restoration but unfortunately are only passing through the city on vacation and will return to Sao Paulo this week.

All in all I like working with my companion.  He is quite the joke.  At first I thought he liked to complain, but I finally figured out that that’s just his way of joking around.  He’s a real laugh.  Our zone had an emergency transfer this week so we lost our buddy Elder Shipley and got Elder Vaz.  Everyone seems to be happy and the work is going better now, so we’re happy here.  The only problem is that the elders got here without money to buy food, so I gave away a lot of food this week.  My last two companions have had a lot of desire to work and are proactive, so I feel like I’m ending my mission well.   There is no problem if a lot of the family doesn’t come to KC to see me when I come home, I left like a thief in the night, I will come home the same way… literally.  You’d better hide all the peanut butter and maple syrup.  I will continue to work hard until the end, so have no fears about trunkiness interfering with my work.  I will however inform you that I will be home in eighteen days…   I don’t have a whole lot of time to write, so I will end with expressing my love to you all and my thank you for all you have done to sustain me.  The Lord’s work will always continue, so never get in the comfort zone.  I wish you all a happy week.    Love, Elder Andrews

I am glad to read that Ruths delivery went well.  I am excited to get to know my new nieces and nephews.     I was a little sad to see elder Coburn leave, but that’s life I guess.  Elder M Pereira will help me out with getting people baptized, he has a bit of a strong personality and is very bold in his teaching.  I figure I will just go with it and see if it works.  So far, I think it is.  Elder Eliakim left the area in pretty good condition and there are a number of people who have good potential to get baptized this transfer.  I studied the message in the mission news letter about the power of prayer.  I really understand the importance of being obedient and have a greater desire to gain power through obedience.  In conference this week, I noticed that that seemed to be a repeated theme in what I was hearing.  I spoke with E. Pereira about how we can help our zone out and get more baptisms.  We came up with some good plans and decided that we need to help the zone be more obedient to qualify for the blessings we wish for.  This week I started to feel a temptation to get dissapointed about finishing the mission and that I have not done a good job, and while its true that there is always much more that we could have done, I was feeling that I haven’t done very well as a missionary.  But I know that the devil will try with all his might to weaken me with doubt.  I know the answer to such feelings is repentance and work.  So I prayed for more help and took more teaching experiences.  And it works.    Elder M Pereira is doing well, is good at giving invitations to be baptized or go to church, but his teaching could use some improvement.  So I am helping him there and he is already getting better.  I think he will be just fine as a senior missionary.  He will work, and work well.     I love you all and hope that all goes well back at home.  Have a great week.         Love, Elder Andrews

PereiraUnião da Vitória IIZona União da VitóriaDear President Queiroz,  Thank you for your response to my email.  I am adjusting gradually to my companion.  He has something of a different kind of sense of humor and I have found that the best way to get used to another’s sense of humor is to go with it and adopt it.  This week we found two decent families and blessed them.  We’ll see where they go with the follow ups.  We had our zone meeting this week in Mafra and gave a training on obedience and having an obedient comportment.  We compared our mission to Zion’s Camp, how there was a call for 500, and only some two hundred went.  Of the two hundred, some were valiant and obedient, some complained and were good only when things went smoothly.  Later on, when the quorums of the twelve and seventy were organized, all except three were chosen from Zion’s Camp- those who were faithful and obedient.  We also read in D&amp;C 103:25-36 about the organization of the camp.  It appears that it was not in the original plan that the Prophet went with them, and they were told to ask that he might go with them and bless them.  So we told the elders to be obedient and pray so that an apostle might come and bless our mission.  I hope it gives them a greater desire to be obedient.       Elder M Pereira is doing well.  He is straightforward and is teaching well.  He also has a lot of good ideas.  I’m old and tired, and not very creative anymore, so it feels good to have a companion that can think up some new stuff.  He is obedient and as far as I can tell, he is doing just fine.    We have spent the last week and a half contacting and teaching the people that the other elders left for us to teach, and I was feeling like we should find some more people and keep looking for new investigators.  Interestingly enough, in the beginning of my mission, finding new people to teach was my hardest challenge, but since your arrival in July and the introduction of the new techniques, it transformed into my favorite thing to do.  With E. M. Pereira it will be easier to do the follow ups and decide who will get baptized or not.  We are working closer to the chapel and our own house, and after only one investigator went to church this week, I have decided to always chase them down and work them into the habit of going to church.  It worked last week, so it should work in the end.  It is really easy to get depressed at the end of your mission and I am being as careful as I can to work to get out of situations where I can get depressed and work hard to feel the Spirit.  I love the missionary work and will work as hard as possible until the end.

Later on, when the quorums of the twelve and seventy were organized, all except three were chosen from Zion’s Camp- those who were faithful and obedient.  We also read in D&amp;C 103:25-36 about the organization of the camp.  It appears that it was not in the original plan that the Prophet went with them, and they were told to ask that he might go with them and bless them.  So we told the elders to be obedient and pray so that an apostle might come and bless our mission.  I hope it gives them a greater desire to be obedient.       Elder M Pereira is doing well.  He is straightforward and is teaching well.  He also has a lot of good ideas.  I’m old and tired, and not very creative anymore, so it feels good to have a companion that can think up some new stuff.  He is obedient and as far as I can tell, he is doing just fine.    We have spent the last week and a half contacting and teaching the people that the other elders left for us to teach, and I was feeling like we should find some more people and keep looking for new investigators.  Interestingly enough, in the beginning of my mission, finding new people to teach was my hardest challenge, but since the arrival of President Queiroz in July and the introduction of the new techniques, it transformed into my favorite thing to do.  With E. M. Pereira it will be easier to do the follow ups and decide who will get baptized or not.  We are working closer to the chapel and our own house, and after only one investigator went to church this week, I have decided to always chase them down and work them into the habit of going to church.  It worked last week, so it should work in the end.  I am glad to hear that all is going well back home and everybody is in good health or recovering well.  Easter went well.  I fasted for the gift of charity and for a greater comprehension of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.  The church didn’t really do anything special for Easter Sunday, which surprised me.  The leader that is currently responsible for the branch is rather inexperienced and said that he was chosen to preside over the branch for lack of having anyone more capable of peaceable.  He is a humble man and I admire him for his courage and goodness.  I love you all and pray for your well being.  I hope that on my return I can be a better person to you all than I was when I left.  Thank you all for your love, support and patience to me.  Have a great week and remember that I love you all.Love Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Telegramish letter do elder shiqueFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 30 Mar 2009 15:55:52 +0000Dear Family,    I did send out my return date to you but for some reason or other it didnt get through to you.  I will get home on Friday May 8th, sometime between 12:00 AM and 12:00 PM.  That’s just forty days away FYI…  I’m getting transferred again, this time to the other side of the river.  I’ll be attending the same branch so I can still see all my converts and friends from my last area. This week we got a lot more done and I think we’re leaving our area better than we found it.  If I’m correct, there is potential to have six baptisms this transfer in the area and perhaps more as well.  I don’t know that I’ve ever gotten to work an entire city before, but I’m excited to make a difference on the other side of the city now.  Now that I am at my last transfer, I will have to keep myself focused and not just wait and suck it up until the end.  I want my last transfer to be my best.  I’m going to work as hard as I can for the next five weeks.  I enjoyed the zone leader counsel this week and learned a lot and this transfer I will be doing better to help my zone out and increase the faith to obey and baptize.    I really enjoyed my transfer with Elder Coburn and we both grew a great deal.  After this transfer and then this next with the assistants, he should be well prepared to be a leader.  He is a great missionary with a strong testimony.   On Saturday, we taught a man who moved here and is living with his aunt (a member of the church) and is waiting for his family to move down here too.  His Aunt gave him a Book of Mormon and he read and liked it and had a great many questions.  So she invited us to come over on Saturday to teach him.  We taught him the first lesson and he promptly accepted the invitation to baptism.  He is not married to his wife, so he –not us- said that he would have to get married.  This man is the type of man that, depending on what his wife he has, will be firm in the church and perhaps a leader in the church.  A couple of weeks ago we knocked a door and it turned out to be a family of a member who had separated from his family and all of his kids were baptized except for the oldest and his (ex) wife.  We gave a powerful blessing there and guess who is looking for religion and went to church yesterday?  The oldest daughter- Kelli.  I’m pretty sure that the next elders will baptize her and her daughter within the next two weeks.     I love you all and hope you all have a great week.  Thank you for all your support and love.  I hope Erin and Jackson are doing alright and GmaZ as well.   Love, Elder Andrews

PereiraUnião da Vitória IIZona União da VitóriaDear President Queiroz,   I was a little sad to see elder Coburn leave, but that’s life I guess.  Elder M Pereira will help me out with getting people baptized, he has a bit of a strong personality and is very bold in his teaching.  I figure I will just go with it and see if it works.  So far, I think it is.  Elder Eliakim left the area in pretty good condition and there are a number of people who have good potential to get baptized this transfer.  I studied the message in the mission news letter about the power of prayer.  I really understand the importance of being obedient and have a greater desire to gain power through obedience.  In conference this week, I noticed that that seemed to be a repeated theme in what I was hearing.  I spoke with E. Pereira about how we can help our zone out and get more baptisms.  We came up with some good plans and decided that we need to help the zone be more obedient to qualify for the blessings we wish for.  This week I started to feel a temptation to get desanimado about finishing the mission and that I have not done a good job, and while its true that there is always much more that we could have done, I was feeling that I haven’t done very well as a missionary.  But I know that the devil will try with all his might to weaken me with doubt.  I know the answer to such feelings is repentance and work.  So I prayed for more help and took more teaching experiences.  And it works.  Elder M Pereira is doing well, is good at giving invitations to be baptized or go to church, but his teaching could use some improvement.  So I am helping him there and he is already getting better.  I think he will be just fine as a senior missionary.  He will work, and work well.  He is doing fine with obedience as well.    Theres not a whole lot to report about our area, we basically spent the week finding the people on the lists left by Elder Eliakim.    One thing that has been bugging me recently is the fault of baptisms in the last year of my mission.  I have noticed that I have a strong tendency to talk a lot and I have given a lot of examples of finding people in my emails to you.  There would appear to be something that doesn’t add up between the number of people I find and in the number of my baptisms.  I love to teach, and if you talk to any of my companions, they may say I teach well and with the spirit, but something I feel that I lack is knowing how to take someone by the hand and lead them to the waters of baptism.  I had one transfer with my trainer who was a wonderful missionary and we baptized a lot.  Then, I spent four transfers with one companion who had no desire to work and kept few rules, and another who didn’t keep rules and we never baptized.  I didn’t really learn to baptize.  And then I turned senior and trainer.  From then on I have occasionally had good companions who helped me, but always for little time.  The elders need to know who to keep teaching, who it is worth to go back, when and why to stop finding when you’ve already found, and how and when to invite the people to make and keep commitments.  With my current companion, I think I will be just fine.  He knows when to invite and is bold in doing so and we will both learn from each other.  I want you to know that I have no doubt that you have been doing the right things for the mission and that my lack of baptisms is not because you came.  I feel that those who were seniors with Pres. Dansie may not be able to partake of the blessings of the mission as much as the rest that arrive and achieve maturity under the new president.  Perhaps we are the forerunners and then arrive the great baptizers.  I feel that the rising generation of the Missao Brasil Florianopolis will be the greatest and will be well prepared.  I will do all that I can to help them, and baptize as much as possible.  Thank you for all that you have done to help us and I love and sustain you.  Our numbers this week are as follows;Bapt/Confirmaçoes………..0/0Bat marcados………………7/2Pesq na sacr...........................6Lições....................................21Novos....................................8

At least we could sift out the wheat from the tares.  On Wednesday night we ventured into unexplored territory into a distant neighborhood called Bom Jesus.  We had marked an appointment with the lady who works the ice cream stand in the center on our way to our area.  It was a real adventure because it is about an hour and a half walk from our house, and we didn’t know when the next bus would be.  When we got there I asked when the next bus would be and she said 11:30 PM.  It was already 8:30, so we needed to get a ride from somebody.  Her neighbors offered a ride and we got home on time just barely.  Needless to say, when we went back the next day we got a ride with a member and marked their baptisms for next week.  Apparently they have some doubts we’ll have to resolve before their baptisms go through.  We didn’t use the bus this week so we didn’t get to do any preaching, but there is this house that we always walk by with a crowd of people out front, so we decided to take the opportunity to teach a group.  We just gave a blessing, but I suppose we will go back again this week. My companion is doing well and is really learning to follow the spirit as he teaches and also how to invite the spirit.  Last night he really brought the spirit as we tried to resolve someone’s concerns about tithing.  I am enjoying teaching with him and doing the work together as well.  He is obedient and likes to work.  There is a boy of 11 years named Gustavo we have been teaching for some time and who has prayed to know if what we teach of the restoration is true and received and answer and wants to be baptized as his older brother and sister have been baptized, but his mom will not let him get baptized until he finishes catechism in three years.  She says that he is too young to make that kind of decision.  If I weren’t so smart, I would have told her that he was too young to make the decision to be baptized catholic when he was four days old.  I told her that it was not his decision, to get baptized in the true church, but that of God, because he had prayed and received an answer from God that it was the right thing to do.  We spent a lot of time there trying to get her to give in, but she just closed her heart to the spirit and rejected it.  It wasn’t the best way to end the week, but we still have faith that we can win her over.  It just wont be easy.    Last night I discovered that the majority of catholics do not have an understanding of what deity is, nor of who Jesus Christ really is.  As we taught this woman, the spirit told me that she does not have faith in Jesus Christ.  She really just believes that there is some God out there and the purpose of religion is to pray and feel peace.  The devil has gathered up all the apostasy that would make himself god and stamped it with the name of Christianity and leads away the greater part of mankind with a counterfeit and a fraud.  I got kind of sad to see that last night and then see her close her heart to the testimony of the spirit when the truth is before her.  Perhaps I can teach with greater testimony of the Living Christ and use the Book of Mormon not just as a proof that Joseph Smith is a prophet, but also that Jesus is the Christ manifesting himself unto all nations.  May I have the strength to open my mouth and spread the Father’s love wherever I go. Well it sounds like Carl is being a safado up there in Ohio.  I am glad to hear that Gma Z will be there when I get home.  I miss my grandmothers.  I wish good luck to dad as he heads up to Ohio.  I hope all goes well with Erin and Ruths births and wish a happy birthday to Anna, Dad and Sydney.  Yesterday I after lunch the members with whom we had eaten turned on BYU TV and the womens chorus was performing.  I was kind of disappointed because I was expecting to see Aurelia on the piano, but the performance must have been from a while ago cause I didn’t see her or any of my cousins.  From all the books listed in Dads last email, it sounds like when I get home, I’ll end up doing a lot of reading. I love you all and thank you for your love, support, prayers and help that you gave me in preparing to serve a mission.  I hope all is well with you and that the Lord bless you and keep you.Love,  Joseph

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: EpistleFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 9 Mar 2009 15:50:02 +0000Dear Family,    Question:  did I hear a hint that Ruth is pregnant?  I knew that Erin should be having a baby here in a month or something, but I haven’t heard anything about Ruth.  Sounds like its more or less uneventful back at home for now.  Yesterday morning while we were on our way to pick up a family at 7:00 AM to take to church and help carry their twins we saw a drunk guy on a motorcycle weave and crash.  Fortunately for drunk people, they don’t feel pain very well, so he just got up again and rode on.  Some people are brilliant.  This week we went out to the city of Mafra to have a zone meeting in preparation for zone conference this week, and while we were doing the training I felt a lot of doubts about the ways we are going about the work we are doing and a lot of the doubts were somewhat confirmed as I passed through Canoinhas to do two baptismal interviews in which I had to teach them what tithing was.  That night, my companion and I stayed up late and conversed with each other about baptism, qualifications for baptism, ways to prepare people better, etc.  This week I am going to talk to president about it to see if we are right about the conclusions we came to.   We started to teach that family that we found and who had prayed to find a path to peace, and boy, it has not been easy.  I had to tell the woman to stop beating her kids, repent and follow the gospel of Jesus Christ to have joy and peace.  She was honestly thinking of doing herself harm, so we told her with all the testimony we could muster that she was a child of God, and that she is precious.  My companion spoke with great power and in the end we gave her a blessing and left a Book of Mormon marked to Alma 36.  It is both applicable to pain caused by sin, as well as to pain caused by abuse, death, depression etc.  Her husband says that they don’t want to get baptized, but that “we have to get baptized”.  It will be a bit of a wait, because they will need to get married, and she was previously married to a guy who after being married for a month, ran away and disappeared, so getting a divorce is a lengthy ordeal.  But she could use the time to prepare herself and undergo the spiritual healing accessible  through repentance and that of receiving the spirit of Christ unto the remission of sins. I have a feeling that I might be “demoted” from being a zone leader this next transfer for not having sufficient baptisms, but I don’t really care that much.  I didn’t really come on a mission for positions, but to serve.  I have had a good amount of baptisms and I can say that when someone is baptized for the wrong reasons, or just isn’t prepared (meaning they haven’t really repented of their sins), I always came away with a sort of empty feeling, as opposed to when I baptize people like Heidy, Tati, Amalia, Marcos, Erica, Mariana, Naiza, Salete, Wilian, or Andressa, I can feel the true joy of having helped someone come unto Christ through faith, repentance, baptism and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost.  And each of those people are my friends, and will not fall away if they follow a true course.  There are many others who were not baptized, but they did repent.  I love to be a missionary and a representative of Jesus, our beloved Savior.  I hope to serve Him in the best way possible.  I love each of you and pray for you always that the Lord bless you and keep you.          Love, Elder Andrews

On Thursday, we taught two power lessons in the evening and I think one of those people could easily be turned into a baptism in the coming two weeks.  It really will depend on his mom, but we are also working with the mom to soften her up for getting baptized.  With all the new investigators we have gotten in the last weeks, I think we can start to just cut people we don’t think will be baptized and stick with the people that have more potential.  Our new convert’s mom went to the baptism on Saturday and we have already invited her to get baptized, to which she said she would pray about it.  We ll get her in the end.  I really enjoyed conference this week and learned a lot about how I can improve my teaching skills and just how to be a better missionary in general. Elder Coburn is doing well and I am preparing him as best I can to be a senior missionary and work well.  I hope I can teach him how to baptize as well.  He is teaching with power and with the spirit and I am ever excited to see him grow.     Friday we went into all the radio stations in town to see if we could do some kind of a broadcast.  The first place said we would be able to do free radio invitations to activities such as football games and stuff, but to give a message, you would have to pay, and besides that, there were no more openings for speaking time because all the other evangelical churches have eaten up the time and even have their own radio spot set apart on the daily broadcast schedule.  That kind of upset me, because we are the true church.  Shouldn’t they just let us take the time to tell the truth?  We left that radio station feeling kind of down, but we just sang to ourselves the song from High School Musical 2- “We can work, work, work this out…”, knowing that if it’s the Lord’s true church, He would provide a way to spread the truth.  The next radio station had no one to attend us, so that just blew right over, and we went to the last radio station praying that the Lord would help us.  I asked Elder Coburn if he thought I always know what to do.  He said yes.  I just told him that I never know what to do and just wing it praying like there’s no tomorrow that the Spirit will guide me.  I always thought that companions knew what to do, but I think they were probably a lot more like me- lost, but guided.  We went to the last place with a prayer in our heart and managed to get permission to go upstairs and talk with the owner.  I knew that what I wanted to do (a broadcast of testimony and an invitation to come unto Christ and be baptized by someone with authority) would normally cost money, so I knew I had to offer an idea that wouldn’t work and was asking for a lot less than I wanted, and then bargain my way up to more or less what I was wanting, so I gave a weak idea.  The guy said there were some draw backs to my “idea” and saw that we didn’t have any money to offer, so I asked him to come up with an idea.  He said we could do something by way of journalism in stead of publicity.  They would do an interview with us in a way that we could put out our invitations in a safe, free way.  So we recorded an interview on the spot.

We really came out of the station in high spirits!  Every time we ride the bus as well, we will teach a small lesson with power and when the spirit comes on, we will give an invitation to follow the Savior and be baptized.  If one out of every ten people invited has at least a desire to DO something, and accept the invitation, even if it be a tentative acceptance, most likely one out of every thirty people would be baptized.  If every week follows the standard of excellence, we should find a person to be baptized every three weeks knocking doors.  However, if you give an invitation to a bus full of people, lets say that one in every twenty five people accepts an invitation.  If you ride the bus six times a week, you should find, at the least, three people who accept.  If one in three go through with it, that increases our baptisms to one per week, not counting family members of the one accepting.  If we give an invitation over the radio with a decent follow up method, that would roughly reach the ears of 1000 people in a given day depending on the hour.  If one in every fifty is touched by the invitation, you have twenty people ready to be taught and maybe five would be baptized.  If we open our mouth, we can baptize.Our numbers this week are as follows;Bapt/conf………………………..1/1Bapt marc………………………..0/0Pesq na igr……………………….1Lições............................................33Novos............................................21

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: The Coburn report...From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 16 Mar 2009 16:46:55 +0000Dear Family,  I talked with the assistants this week and Elder Stephanou, who is going home with my group, said that we are leaving the mission on the 7th of may, so I will be getting home on the 8th some time during the day, or morning.  That makes me a little trunky, bit it really makes me want to make the most of being a missionary for the last seven weeks.  I am working as hard as I can, so fear not;  Im not a fubecca…  We found alot of new investigators this week, going to appointments and teaching people’s friends with them .  On Thursday, we taught two power lessons in the evening and I think one of those people could easily be turned into a baptism in the coming two weeks.  It really will depend on his mom, but we are also working with the mom to soften her up for getting baptized.  With all the new investigators we have gotten in the last weeks, I think we can start to just cut people we don’t think will be baptized and stick with the people that have more potential.  Our new convert’s mom went to the baptism on Saturday and we have already invited her to get baptized, to which she said she would pray about it.  We ll get her in the end.  We had  zone conference this week and I really enjoyed it and learned a lot about how I can improve my teaching skills and just how to be a better missionary in general.   Elder Coburn is doing well and I am preparing him as best I can to be a senior missionary and work well.  I hope I can teach him how to baptize as well.  He is teaching with power and with the spirit and I am ever excited to see him grow.     Friday we went into all the radio stations in town to see if we could do some kind of a broadcast.  The first place said we would be able to do free radio invitations to activities such as football games and stuff, but to give a message, you would have to pay, and besides that, there were no more openings for speaking time because all the other evangelical churches have eaten up the time and even have their own radio spot set apart on the daily broadcast schedule.  That kind of upset me, because we are the true church.  Shouldn’t they just let us take the time to tell the truth?  We left that radio station feeling kind of down, but we just sang to ourselves the song from High School Musical 2- “We can work, work, work this out…”, knowing that if it’s the Lord’s true church, He would provide a way to spread the truth.  The next radio station had no one to attend us, so that just blew right over, and we went to the last radio station praying that the Lord would help us.  I asked Elder Coburn if he thought I always know what to do.  He said yes.  I just told him that I never know what to do and just wing it praying like there’s no tomorrow that the Spirit will guide me.  I always thought that companions knew what to do, but I think they were probably a lot more like me- lost, but guided.  We went to the last place with a prayer in our heart and managed to get permission to go upstairs and talk with the owner.  I knew that what I wanted to do (a broadcast of testimony and an invitation to come unto Christ and be baptized by someone with authority) would normally cost money, so I knew I had to offer an idea that wouldn’t work and was asking for a lot less than I wanted, and then bargain my way up to more or less what I was wanting, so I gave a weak idea.  The guy said there were some draw backs to my “idea” and saw that we didn’t have any money to offer, so I asked him to come up with an idea.  He said we could do something by way of journalism in stead of publicity.  They would do an interview with us in a way that we could put out our invitations in a safe, free way.  So we recorded an interview on the spot.  It should be broadcasting a few more times this week, and I think we might go back and see if we cant expand on the idea with them and do it again, this time for a little bit longer and for a more in depth interview.  We really came out of the station in high spirits!  Every time we ride the bus as well, we will teach a small lesson with power and when the spirit comes on, we will give an invitation to follow the Savior and be baptized.  If one out of every ten people invited has at least a desire to DO something, and accept the invitation, even if it be a tentative acceptance, most likely one out of every thirty people would be baptized.  If every week follows the standard of excellence, we should find a person to be baptized every three weeks knocking doors.  However, if you give an invitation to a bus full of people, lets say that one in every twenty five people accepts an invitation.  If you ride the bus six times a week, you should find, at the least, three people who accept.

If one in every fifty is touched by the invitation, you have twenty people ready to be taught and maybe five would be baptized.  If we open our mouth, we can baptize. I love each of you and repremand you for not telling me that Ruth was pregnant...  But I forgive you, Im excited to see my awesome nieces and nephews when I go home.  I pray for you and thank you for your prayers, especially whoever it is who is praying for my health- my entire zone is sick except for elder Andrews…  I have been out for a year and ten months and I still have never gotten sick!  Knock on wood…  Have an excellent week!   Love, Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Elder Andrews, Uniao 1From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: presidentequeiroz@gmail.comDate: Mon, 23 Feb 2009 15:21:54 +0000Elder AndrewsElder CoburnicusUnião da Vitória 1Zona União da VitóriaDear President Queiroz,   This week was great.  I’m not going to lie, I was a little bit worried about the new standards of excellence, but in the end, things started to work out well.  Thank you for letting me be with Elder Coburn, we are having a good time together and we have a lot in common.  Every day this week, we have had a really good experience teaching and with the work in general.  We like singing before every lesson and it brings the spirit rather strongly.  On Thursday morning during companionship study, He taught me the 2nd lesson and I could feel the spirit as he taught.  The way that he taught reminded me of the beginning of my mission.  Its good to remember the fire that you come into the mission with.  He teaches well, bears testimony well and is just a good missionary.   I feel my faith increasing in the fact that the Lord is preparing people for us to teach.  We have found so many widows and widowers this last week that you might even think half the city died some years ago.  We taught the 2nd lesson to Salete, the woman who felt the presence of an angel last week during the blessing, so she knows what the plan is and where her parents are and that she can be with them again.  So I asked if we could come back teach her about how we do it.  She knows what the plan is, so now the only thing left is for her to follow.  On Saturday night we were invited with the elders of the other side of the city to a member’s birthday party that would have some non members there, but it wasn’t even in our area, so the investigators wouldn’t even be ours, so we declined and decided to go try and find some people.  It was tough, because everyone and there dog was partying or busy watching carnival on TV.  But after much rejection, and wading through tribulations of every specie…, we found a family who gladly accepted us and felt the spirit strongly during the blessing.  So we went back last night and taught the 1st lesson about the restoration of the gospel.  They understood well but the father and mother were kind of reluctant to accept baptism, but I could tell their 14 year old daughter felt the spirit and really wanted to get baptized.  We marked their baptisms for two weeks from now, though the daughter, Edna will probably get baptized first, then Alcioní, the father and then the mother.  We are going back tomorrow night.    I feel that a lot can happen here with E. Coburn, because he has faith, testimony and wants to work.  He’s not particularly concerned about himself as much as he is with the work.  Its been a while since Ive had a companion like that.  Its kind of a relief.  We will also be having a baptism this Saturday.  On Saturday morning, we did the dedication of our areas.  We climbed Morro da Cruz and upon getting to the top, there was a badly kept open area with a statue of the Savior and some private property with a huge open field.  So I decided we should ask the owner of the property if we could go out into the field and pray.  Elder Eliakim was somewhat reluctant to ask but I said I would do the talking.  So we clapped out hands outside the gate and out came a woman.  I said “Oi, nos somos quarto humildes servos de Deus, e subimos o morro para fazer uma oração, mas aqui fora não é muito bom para fazer a oração.  Será que  a gente pode usar o campo ai?”  She said yes.  So we went out about 200 feet from the house and started.  It went well.  I’m not sure though, because Elder Hill didn’t really seem too accepting.  I will ask the Lord to see if He accepts the dedication, and act accordingly.  It really was the perfect place to do it though.  As we left, we stopped at the house to thank the woman and she invited us to come back to pray any time we wanted.  I told E. Eliakim that they should probably go back and convert her –if they really wanted to brave the climb up the hill…  Well that is about how our week went and I feel confidant that the Lord will bless us with success as we serve him and love Him as best as possible.  Our numbers this week are as follows;Bapt/conf………………………0/0Bapt marc para 2 semanas..........4/2Pesq na reunião sacr....................1Lições..........................................21Novos pesq..................................16Endereços....................................23Lemb se disto..............................95%Qualificar se................................100%Have a great week president.  We love you and I pray for you and the other leaders always.  We are getting ready to BATIZAR O POVO!!!!             Love, Elder Andrews

On Tuesday, I went on a division with E. Hill to help him out, talk to him and give him a break.  Elder Eliakim was happy to let elder Hill be with another American for a day.  I think it turned out well.  Elder Hill teaches well and as he taught, I remembered the beginning of my own mission and how I didn’t really know how to say everything that I wanted to say, so the only thing that I could say was my testimony.  I think that I could revert my teaching back to the basics and have some more success.  I am always happy to see Elder Pimentel at the counsel and talk to him.  I always come away with more desire to be a better missionary and exercise my faith.  I was somewhat intimidated with the new standard of excellence, but at the same time I knew it was the right thing for the mission to be doing.  The next two days the Lord blessed me with assurances that if we increase our faith by making higher goals and expectations, he makes it work.  Elder Moody is doing well, though when I left on Thursday for a baptismal interview in Canoinhas, nothing happened in our area for two days.  I got a little worried when he told me.  Our numbers suffered for it too.  He seems excited to be going to Rio Grande do Sul.    Our branch seems to like us and is willing to help and our lider da obra is really starting to get excited and wants to imply some of our ideas to the maximum.  Tomorrow morning Elder Eliakim and I will go to some of the schools and “advertise” our English class so we can get more people to the class and ready to be baptized.  On Saturday, we were supposed to have an appointment at ten in the morning, but we missed the bus, so we kind of sat at the bus station wondering what to do.  So I asked E. Moody if he wanted to make a mass contact with all the people sitting in the station, but he seemed kind of doubtful.  So I told him what it was that we would say and as I was showing him, a lady and her family sat down next to us.  Instead of standing up and doing the contact, I turned around and started talking to her.  Her name is Salete and after a couple of minutes, I offered to go to her house and give her a blessing to which she complied.  We marked to go to her house on Sunday(yesterday).  Yesterday morning before going off to church, in our prayer I used the priesthood to invoke the ministry of angels to be with us for the day and work together with us.  I learned A LOT in church and when we went to Salete’s house, we discovered that she has lost both her parents and her husband as well.  I felt inspired to ask her “If the Lord showed you a way for you to be with your mother, father and husband again, not just till death do you part, but for ever;  would you do what He told you?”  She then said that she still misses her mother very much and just a day ago she cried for saudades for her mother.  She said that if she could be with her just one more time, she would do anything the Lord asked.  I would have been a fool to not have said something, so I promised her that He would show that way and even bore testimony of the sealing power which seals me to my own deceased mother.  I felt that surely after twenty years in the spirit world, her mother must have heard the gospel and felt the desire to follow.  So we did the blessing.  During the prayer, I felt prompted to invoke the presence of angels in the home and that they could even feel the love of their entes queridos comforting them.  Afterward, I told them the feelings they were feeling were the feelings of the spirit to which Salete said “Yeah, I do feel a relief and a peace.  During the prayer, I could feel that there was someone standing right there (pointing her finger to her side) praying with us.”  I assured her there had been someone present with us.  We are going back on Sunday to teach her and her family.     Just one more experience- more or less an hour later, our appointments fell through and there was nothing for us to do.  I prayed several times for inspiration as to what we should do and where to go.  Usually I receive an impression as to what we should do, but this time, nothing.  So we just walked aimlessly for a couple of minutes waiting.  We were about to pass a street when I felt like we should go there.  So we turned down the street and I felt that we were to encounter someone important.  We knocked the first door and nobody was home, so we crossed the street to another house and knocked and a woman came out.  So I started to talk and in the middle of the contact when I was talking about the blessing she invited us in.  Her husband was watching a soccer game, so we just talked for a while with them both and introduced ourselves.  So they turned off the TV and we got to talk about who we were and why we were there.  Beatriz, the woman, said she used to be catholic, but upon reading the bible she decided that the Savior didn’t want her to worship images so she stopped going to the catholic church and prays at home, and maybe the Lord would show her a better way someday.  When she said this, the spirit told me to say “The Lord has heard your prayers and sent us to your house to show you what to do.”  We got set up for the blessing and we knelt down when I remembered that we forgot to explain about how to recognize the spirit.  So really quickly I quoted Galatians 5:22 and how the spirit has the purpose and mission to testify of the truth, and that they would feel the spirit in the prayer testifying that we were true representatives of Jesus Christ.  As I explained all this, I felt  the spirit already testifying and when I got to the part where I explained that the Spirit would show that we were the true representatives of Jesus Christ, Beatriz said “Mas eu já senti isso quando deixei vocês entrar na portão.”  Needless to say we are going back tomorrow with a member and we are going to baptize that woman as soon as possible. What I gather from these two experiences is that the angels and the spirit are willing to do anything and everything if we just set out our intentions in humble prayer, exercise the Priesthood and act in faith.  This week on Thursday, we will go up on morro da cruz and do the dedication of our area.  I feel confidant that in the strength of the Lord, I can do all things, but alone, I am absolutely nothing.  Our numbers this week are as follows;Bapt conf……………..0/0Bapt marked………….3/1Pesq na igr……………1Liç com membro…......16Novos………………...12Endereços……………..21Lemb s dis.....................91%Qualificar se..................100%

Last week I wrote that we would be having a baptism on Saturday (28th of February), but as we continued teaching the prospective member, we thought there was a chance that we could turn one baptism into two.  His Mom hasn’t been taught yet, his brother is a recent convert, and I think it would be good if we could get the whole family baptized, so we decided to postpone the baptism.  He also needed to fulfill a couple more of the commitments in the first lesson.  Every day that passes has a great experience, be it finding someone, a powerful lesson, or some kind of miracle.  But I’ll cover some of those in the last part of my letter.  We met with the district counselor that is responsible for our branch this week to let him know what we are doing and of some of our concerns about retention and how we would like to help the branch grow.  We all like irmão Rodrigues, so I think all should go well there.    Elder Coburn is doing well and we both enjoy teaching together, though I need to put a little more pressure on him to teach and get used to doing the dirty work with me if he is to be a senior companion logo.  He is teaching well and I am working hard to make sure he knows how to teach the first two commandments and the commandments as well.  I have always noted that teaching the commandments has never been a strong point in our mission, perhaps in the rest of the missions as well, but I got a pretty decent idea from Pres. Monteigas’ address to the general priesthood in the district priesthood conference last week.  It’s a good way to focus on the family too.  First we read the parable of the talents in Matthew 25:14-30ish and talk about what the investigators “talents” of gold are with which the Lord has entrusted them.  They almost always respond with their family.  Then we tell them that the message of the parable is that the Lord expects a DIFFERENCE, not just that we bear through having kids and raising them until we are free.  So we teach them how to edify their family, to increase their “talent” two fold through first kneeling in prayer as a family every day, reading the scriptures every day, example of paying tithes, keeping high standards of moral worthiness etc, until you teach all the commandments.  I must say, it brings the spirit very strongly. Our area is doing well, the relationship with the members seems well and we will be doing some family nights this week with the members and lets find some people to be converted!!!  Nobody really likes the idea of getting to lunch and having to leave for fifteen minutes to do contacts, especially during the lunch hour, but this week, we decided to be obedient, so when we got to lunch on Tuesday, lunch wouldn’t be ready for another 20 minutes, so we left to do some contacts.  In that twenty minutes, we found someone that had been set for baptism some years ago but had not been allowed to be baptized.  So we offered to stop by another day and give a blessing to the family, which they accepted.  So we are going back tomorrow and we will see if we can’t get a baptism out of it.   The next afternoon after lunch, our appointments fell through, and as you probably already know, the hours immediately following lunch are the hardest, but we decided to knock some doors and find somebody new.  The second door we knocked was a woman who said that “to be completely honest”, if it were only a blessing we were offering and not a bible study, she would accept.  So we went in and talked for a few moments and found out she and her family, together with her daughter’s family had just moved to Uniao da Vitoria the day before.  We sang “Where can I turn for Peace” and the whole spirit of the house changed.  A feeling of calm came over everyone and we knelt and blessed them and their families.  When we got up, the woman, Anita, was crying and I told her the feelings she was feeling were the fruits of the Holy Ghost, testifying that we were true servants of the Savior.  She told us that less than an hour beforehand, she had been on the back porch weeping and praying that the Lord would show her a light and give a way to have peace.  She said that the Lord had answered her prayer.  She invited us to come back anytime too, despite the fact that before she had said that she “didn’t want to do any bible study”.  I even told her that we don’t do Bible studies.  We help people come unto Christ.  To say the LEAST, we were kind of happy when we left the house.  All in all, we are doing alright and look forward to zone conference next week, and we are going to prepare the zone for conference and give some trainings this week about teaching the lessons.

I got a letter from Paul Alan Woodbury this week talking about angels.  I’d appreciate it if you forwarded this letter to him, seeing as it fits in exactly with what he wrote me.   I love you all and pray for your well being and hope that the Lord protects you and blesses you for your spiritual and temporal support which you all give me,              Love, Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Elder Andrews, Uniao 1From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: presidentequeiroz@gmail.comDate: Mon, 9 Feb 2009 14:48:13 +0000Elder AndrewsElder MoodyUniao da Vitoria 1Zona União da VitóriaDear President Queiroz, This week I did a fast and got our dedicatory prayer written out finally.  I felt relieved to have it done at last.  Now we need to choose a place to go and do the prayer.  If you would like, I can send you a copy of it later on.  I did a division with Elder Grisham this week and we talked a little about the progress of the work.  We both know that in this mission it has been prophesied that we will baptize thousands and we have been thinking about the scripture in Alma 26:22 about the formula for having so many baptisms.  We both agreed that it is impossible to attain this goal just by knocking doors.  I read all of Acts on monday and tuesday and saw that the apostles had success baptizing and converting thousands because they taught in groups.  Acts 1-5 it says that they taught in the TEMPLE.  On his mission, Paul always started his tour of the city going to the SYNAGOGS, and when that wouldnt work (which times were few) he would go to the market to preach, or a school.  It says that he taught in a school for three years and the whole city became advised.  D&amp;C 68 starts off with a command for all elders called to the work; That they go from place to place, land to land preaching in the synagogs of the wicked, reazoning with them and expounding the scriptures unto them in accordanceto what the spirit directs them to say.  In alma 21, it says that the sons of mosiah had great success in their preaching in the synagogs.  So I am thinking that this week I will stop by a start up church in my area that Ive noticed from time to time and request a few moments to bear my testimony of the savior, read some scriptures to them and follow what the Spirit directs.  There are some elders that have gone to churches already, but it has not been a repeated process.  It was done mostly for the glory of men, and therefore it came to nothing.  However, if we go in with the intent to find someone in that church to be baptized, the Lord will bless us with miracles.  When I was in Tubarao, I did an interview with the District Leader for Criciuma(E Cornaby) and he said that the elders in Criciuma 2 were desanimated.  I told him to spend a couple of afternoons with the other elders and split up and knock a street each companionship with the intent of finding at least one good person report afterward.  Its one thing to knock doors of an entire street, and another to excercise faith in finding.  The same is applicable to teaching in a church.  Begin with the end in mind.          Elder Moody is doing alright.  He gets frustrated if we get home after 9:00 though.  This week he got frustrated about several things and told elder Hill.  So Elder Hill told me what was going on.  It was all news to me.  From time to time I notice that Elder Moody is not happy, so I ask if anything is wrong and he says no.  But after all that he has been haveing a good time and has been happier these last few days.           Our area is doing well and those two young women that came to enlish class have a high chance at being baptized.  After english class on saturday, the youth started to play volley ball and the two girls (Gabriella and Kristina) played too.  now they feel comfortable with the members and coming to church, so as soon as the elders on the other side start teaching them, we ll be on a roll.             we figured out how to find Vera (that mom that wont let her daughter be baptized yet) at her member cousins house on Sunday nights, So last night we stopped by, chatted a little and asked the member if we could leave a message(just like we did last week...) so we sang a childs prayer and taught hte first lesson.  Vera kind of sat off to the side and tried not to pay attention.  We invited the member and her familyl to bear their testimonies to each other and the spirit was REALLY strong.  But Vera still wasnt really paying attention, so at last, she just got up to leave with someone else, but I told her we werent finished yet.  I looked straight into her eyes and said;  You probably think we are really smart and sneaky teaching all this while youre here and all, but Ill go ahead and tell you now that this lesson was taught specially for and to YOU.  I then felt the spirit give me a go ahead to speak freely and bear powerfull testimony of our purpose, the retored Gospel and of our Savior Jesus Christ.  I think weve got her.  Just another week and another conversation about her daughter and we should bew able to baptize her daughter.         Last night I had a long conversation with Elder Hill.  He is vry concerned about how many times a person needs to go to church to get baptized and some of the requirements to be baptized as well.  I dont think he sustains some of your decisions in the way of teaching.  Im talking to Elder Eliakim quite a bit as well and boy, I dont think its easy for them.  Elder Eliakim is tired.  Hes been working like a trainer for over six months and sometimes feels alone in the planning and decisions.  After talking to him, he seems to feel better.  We agreed to do a division tomorrow and see what we can do to be better.  I talked to Elder Burke this week as well and said some encouraging things to him.  I think his last week will be better.  As for me, I sustain you and know that you are called of God, that the prophecies made of our mission can and will be fulfilled if we do all that we can to bring the people to feel as we have felt, to see eye to eye as we have seen, and to know, even as we know, and the knowlede that we posess is not of men, but of God.  May the Lord bless you and keep you.  You, Sister Queiroz and the assistants are always in my prayers.        Our numbers this week are as follows;bapt conf......................0/0bapt markd....................4/2pesq na igr....................1liç c membro..................23novos..........................13endereços.....................28qualificar......................100%Lemb s dist....................91%Have a great week.

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Elder Andrews, Uniao da Vit 1From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: presidentequeiroz@gmail.comDate: Mon, 2 Feb 2009 14:05:09 +0000Elder AndrewsElder MoodyUnião da Vitória 1Zona União da Vitória.Dear President Queiroz,  These last few weeks my mind has been frequently reverted back to the beginning of my mission.  By far that was one of my favorite times on my mission;  I was learning the language and the only things I knew to talk about were the gospel and my testimony, I had alot of baptisms, and it seems my faith was stronger as left the MTC.  I realized I had more hope in finding people ready to be baptized, who were ready and elect.  So this week I spent a good amount of study time going through my study journals and reviewing lessons, inspirations and promptings during my stint at the MTC.  I must say, it is EXTREMELY profitable to keep your impressions noted in an organized manner.  I feel my faith increasing and I have a greater desire to bear testimony instead of preaching.  In the majority of my teaching situations I have also begun to ask myself "What would Jesus say to help them- how would he treat them?"  My faith increases and I am repenting daily- I seek not so much pardon from sin, but to be redeemed from my fallen nature and made a saint through the Atonement of Christ.         Elder Moody is very quiet, especially when he is tired, but I have noticed that as I listen to him bear testimony, I feel power.  I feel that he really does have a testimony and I am glad to see that I am not alone.  He has been really tired as of late, so I m going to see If we cant get done with our planning sessions earlier and maybe get an extra 1/2 hour of sleep at night for him.  Elder Hill likes talking, so sometimes it is dificult, but we ll manage.           Our area is doing well and on saturday in our english class someone came who heard the announcement on the radio and the class was a success in that we got two good adresses out of it- both for the other missionaries, but oh well.  I have been praying for the spirit to guide me and I have plead for the Lord to put in effect His promise that "I will go before your face; I will be on your right and your left and my spirit in your Heart..." and as I thought about it, I really ought to pay attention then.  If He is in front of me, He probably wants to lead, not just follow whereever we decide.  Adopting that perspective, I recognized alot of promptings to do contacts or teach in the streets.  We have an investigator who goes to church every week and goes to all activities but her mother wont let her get baptized.  We told the investigator, Silmara, to fast and that we would fast with her.  As I began the fast on Saturday afternoon, I was praying in the chapel.  As I prayed, I felt impressed to pray even more for her mother, beyond that her heart would be softened, but that she would also have a desire to be baptized.  Excercising hte priesthood, I invoked the presence of angels to be with her, to give her a manifestation and change her heart.  Yesterday we were at her cousins house( who is a member) and we decided to leave a message.  So we started reading 3Nephi 17 and afterward we sang "I wonder when He comes again".  As I bore my testimony after the song, I looked over my shoulder and saw Vera (Silmaras Mom).  I dont know when she arrived, but I continued to bear my testimony and then E. Moody bore his testimony as well.  I felt the assistance of angels as we taught.  On sunday we will have an FHE with them all and Silmara and her mother.  Lets see if we cant succeed in baptizing them both.  This week I was pondering the help which we are entitled to recieve from the other side of the veil.  Angels purposes are set forth in Moroni 7 31-36.  I would ask; do they want to help out with miracles when those with mouths do not open them?  The powers of heaven are excercised only as we courageoulsy use them in EXCEEDINGLY great faith.  I have to repent and use my resources.  I felt the prompting during zone conference to use the radio.  Its free on wednesdays and thursdays and besides, What do you think Ammon would do if he could get his hands on a radio?  Didnt Alma wish to have the voice of an angel to declare repentance to all the ends of the world?  Its time to get to work!         I really enjoyed zone conference, I learned alot and feel much more confident about the work we do.  This week after I read Sister Queiroz's message in the rede, I decided we souyld clean our apartment.  It took alot of work to bleach out Elder Wiricks name off mold in the wall, but we got it done and killed all the many spiders in our room too.  Our bedroom is my little sanctuary now.  I feel better.

I dont think it died, just got stunned, so we kicked it out of the apartment.  This morning we went out into the trees behind our house to go bird hunting with hangers.  they make for good boomerangs, even though its pretty much impossible to hit anything with them.  It was great for a good laugh sneaking around throwing hangers.         I hope you all have a great week and know that I love you and am gratefull for your love and support.     Love Joseph

I have only been rejected maybe five times.  Whenever I mark down an adress, I mark on a scale of 1-10 what I think their receptivity and potential are, and I made a goal back in Tubarao to only contact 7-10s.  Here it seems like everybody is a 8-9!  This week when Elder Moody and I do our weekly planning session, we will put together a new system of adress "filtering".  I also talked with him as we were walking this week and he said he can usually tell if someone will get baptized or not based on their receptivity, their eyes, their movements etc., and I feel the same way.  You can usually tell if someone will follow or not, so we decided to just search out those who we can tell will have an attitude to follow.  we re going to plan that out tomorrow in our planning session as well.          Elder moody is a humble man and I am liking serving with him.  we are getting along fine and I try to compliment him on anything I can.  He is a good missionary.         This week we met with the branch mission leader and we got an english class planned out for saturdays and got it announced on the radio as well.  I think we will probably try to put on a short movie or message at the beginning of classes.  I think it will have a healthy turn out.  We also planned an integration night for the first week in Feb, and will start to train the ward missionaries how to get a family integrated.  We want to start focusing more on whole families for baptism.  I gave a 15 min. talk at the last minute in chuch yesterday, and it went well.  I talked about coming unto Christ, gaining a testimony and being converted.  I knew the key to gettingthe Branch presidents trust was to not say anything about it being a last minute talk, and just say I was happy to speak.  I think it worked.  As I left Tubarao, I felt that I was very distant with the ward leadership and did not really make a great difference in the ward, so I made a goal to help involve the members in the missionary work and help the ward grow in not only baptisms(Which I hope to have many here) but also in spirituality and unity as well.  I only have four months left of my mission and yesterday I felt a real desire to do a greater work than I have been doing, to perform the Lords work according to His will and in His way.  I will search out the elect and bring them to Zion and be healed of their sins and pains, and in the end, recieve Eternal Life.         In zone meeting on Friday we looked up a bunch of scriptures listed in the "Activity; Personal Study" part of Chapter four in Preach My Gospel after the section "The power of the Holy Ghost in Conversion" and we noticed a pattern in the process of what we feel in conversion; 1) we ponder on what had been spoken2) we hunger for further knowledge3) we pray and repent, we come to know for ourselves and we follow with full purpose of heart        I explained that the key to this happening is dependent on what we feel, and our level of conversion; And now, many have been brought to feel even as I have felt, and many have seen eye to eye even as I have seen, and do know even as I do know, and the knowledge that I have is of God(Alma 36: 21-28ish).  Ammon said that to him that REPENTETH, prays always and does good works, to him shall be granted success.  Repentance is not just repentance of sin, but is the act of giving up the natural man and delivering up our hearts to God.  We have to do that every day, just like Alma did, and retain our change of heart.            Our numbers this week were as follows;Bapt/Conf..........................0/0Bapt marked.......................3/2Pesq na igr..........................1liç c memb...........................3novos.................................19endereços............................48Lemb s disto.........................96%Qualifiar-se..........................100%I think we will do contacts like crazy and look for the elect who are ready to be baptized this week.  To be continued...       Thanks for all you do, we pray for you and are greatfull for your love and support,   Love Elder Andrews,

I love the woodbury clan and my own brothers and sisters and nieces and nephews.  I miss going to the temple and feeling the remarkable feelings of peace and purpose that are felt there.  I hope to be able to go with you at least one more time to the tmeple.  Your example and that of Grandpa have been inspiring to me throughout my life and I want to thank you for the legacy of faith you have given to me.  I miss singing with my family, with my cousins and especially Charles.  I remember singing a song with Paul Paul and Charles and Lauren after a thanksgiving in 2006.  I simply love to sing.         I enjoy being in the service of my God, and to tell the truth, Im kind of sorry to be leaving in four months.  I wil most certainly apply what I have learned here in my church callings and my day to day life when I return.  I forgot which missions Paul Alan and Nathan went to, and if you could, I would apreciate it if you or someone else could send me their mission adresses so I can write to them on their missions and share experiences.  I am very excited to hear about Charles and Kellys engagement.  I am so happy that I will be able to attend.  What a blessing.          I love you Grandma, and I pray that all is well with you and that you can feel the love of your Whole family.  It is the same love which you worked your whole life to cultivate in us.  I hope all continues well with you and I hope to see you when I return.          Love, Elder Joseph Andrews

I always feel ready to work and repent at transfers.  Its a good feeling.  Elder Moody is doing alright and we get along just fine.  I really like my new area and I like the branch.  It seems alot stronger than many of the wards I have already served in.  My faith increases continually and I am grateful to be serving in the kindom of the Lord.    When I finally arrived in Uniao da Vitoria on Friday, I lost Elder Moody’s package that was sent to the office.  I felt really bad and know it must have been tough, but I think he forgave me.  From what I can see of E. Moody’s character, he should be an excellent missionary.  We have high hopes for our area.   Our first and second lunches in the area were with the branch president and the District President.  I want to take an active role in the branch and help it grow, so I managed to get myself invited to the executive commitee meeting on Wednesday and we spoke with the branch mission leader and got some ideas together for teaching families and how to train ward missionaries and have families integrate with another that is inactive and partmember for retention.  We also talked about getting on the radio and advertising an english class as well.  I think we are off to a good start with the leadership of the branch.  I love to find new people to teach and feel kind of like a detective searching out the people who the old missionaries were teaching.  The last entry in the area book was in November.  But I enjoy it. The busses were full on Wednesday night so we stayed the night with the assistants and staff.  As I studied in the morning, I pondered what Elder Pimentel had told me of dedicating areas and how he follows revelation in his procedures.  I felt the need to pray, so I went to another room to pray alone.  I found myself praying for success in my new area, for many things, and I felt the impression that I too should dedicate our areas.  So I started writeing down what needed to be done and start a fast to recieve revelation concerining the process.  I called Elder Eliakim and asked him to fast with me and seek revelation as well.  We know the majority of what we will do, but we are still wondering where we should do it and need to write out the dedicatory prayer.  We intend to carry out the dedication sometime this week with our companions and a member.  I also included your health in my personal fast.  I could not bear seeing you or Sis. Queiroz leaving due to health problems.  These last few weeks, I have felt the company and support of my Mother in my work and prayers.  I recommit myself to do the Lords work penitantly and walk with Him.  I will repent more fully and align my heart to His, that I may be an instrument in His hands.  Our numbers this week were low, seeing as we started working on Friday when I got here, and we are starting from nothing;Bapt/conf..................0/0Bapt marked..............0/0Pesq na igr.................0Liç com membro........1Novos.........................13Endereços..................18Lemb s dis..................91%Qualificar...................100%This week we will get much better and we will do our best to find the elect.  We love you and include you and Sister Queiroz in our prayers.  During the transfer meeting I remember when you said that you were trained to recieve missionaries but are not ready to let others leave.  I wished I could finish my mission out with you.  I thank you and Sister Queiroz for your example and love.  I sustain you and sustain our leader Jesus Christ.  I may not always be able to serve under you, but I will always be able to serve under Him.  Have a great week.                Love, Elder Andrews

FYI Thats a long walk.  We did our first english class with limited success.  I think we will broadcast the anouncement this week again.  I dont know whats up with our house, but we see all kinds of wierd bugs here.  Elder Hill who works on the other side of the river with E. Eliakim is always putting things on my desk, such as a big knife with my name tag hanging on it, or a huge beetle in an upturned glass, etc.  The other night this wierd wood cockrouch flew into our house and just hung out until we kicked it out with a broom.  Its antenae were longer than it was and we learned that bugs can scream.  Unfortunately I didnt get a picture of that one, but I did get one of the big green beetle from four days ago.  It was actually kind of pretty.  Pretty but dumb, just like all beetles and june bugs.         My brown shoes that I ve been using for 20 months are just now getting a hole in the right sole.  Im surprised theyve lasted this long.  They still have another month and a half left in them though.  I took Charles advice and decided to think just a little bit about what I will do when I get home, and Im thinking of either doing something with law or physical therapy.  I guess Ill look into it more when I get home.           I give my ENTHUSUASTIC congradjulashtions to Charles on his engagement.  Im happy that I will be able to be there when He gets married.  Im pretty excited.  I got an email from Gma Woodbury this week and Im glad to know she is doing well.  It seems that she had a good holiday season.  Im glad Morgan is going teaching with the Elders.  I hope he learns to bear his testimony and listen to people.  I love to talk with people and see how I can help them and give them strentgh to overcome their fears and follow with faith.  Some people do, others dont, but when I see a person truly come unto Christ, Its worth all the pain.  What joy I have to look back on the past 20 months and remember the people who have been blessed through my service.  Its all worth it and more.  I hope you all have a great week and know that I love you and pray for you.         Love Joseph

We did a division, had a holiday and went to Florianópolis as well for the conselho dos lideres de zona, which seeing as on both the divisions E Brandão went to the other área, so we really only got to work in our own área for three and a half days this week.  I think it shows a little in our numbers.  On Saturday, it rained cats and dogs and Wind got up to 80 kph.  My umbrella died in one of the gusts so I got a bunch of plastic bags and packed up my books and got a sweater on and we trudged on in the streets/rivers.  But it was OK.  This week I have learned alot, and I greatly enjoyed the conselho.  I feel uplifted and exited to do the work, which helped me out the next day during the rain.  As I look back on my time here, I can see that I lacked some of the charity that I usually have, and I would have liked to interact a little more in peoples lives and help them out in more ways.  So on Sunday I fasted that I might be able to have more charity in my next área, and really love and show love to the people.  All in all, I feel good as I leave Tubarão, and I feel that I really did do the best I could.  I like it here. When I told Elder Brandão that his companion would be Elder Dourado from his own city and stake, he lit up alot and laughed.  I think that they will do well together.  Elder Brandão hás really loosened up these last three months, not quite as much as I wanted, but I think he’ll be just fine.  This new transfer will be the first time I serve with another american, and I confess that Im rather nervous/excited.  I am definately optimistic though.    São joão is doing well.  We frequently play soccer with the Young men, and they like us, even though my mad soccer skills have earned me the nick name “train”.  We currently have more people marked for baptism in Capivari de Baixo than here in tubarão.  Thats kind of surprising and good.  Dilney who is responsible for Capivari was sad to see me go and Said some good things about me that make me feel better about the work we did here.  During the conselho on Friday when we gave an example of starting a first encounter, I testified of the healing power of Jesus Christ;  of how he suffered all our pains.  He knows what we pass through, and as I explained this and how our purpose is to help people to come unto Christ, “that they might be cured”, I remembered a woman we taught in Florianópolis named Salete, whose son was murdered and we helped her come unto Christ(in the end she was baptized) and was totally healed and even forgave the murderer, even though he got away Scott free and even lives in the house in front of her.  As I remembered this, it touched my heart.  I felt the same healing power of peace after my own Mother died, and for this, I knew and know how to help others to excercise faith in the Savior and come unto him and find rest unto their souls.  In every área that Ive passed I have left at least one person who is elect, who come what it may, they will serve the Lord.  I got a letter from one this last week who lives in Itajaí and whose house was inundated in the flood.  She quoted a bunch of scriptures and Said she was already in the book of Helaman in the Book of Mórmon.  She hás only had a Book of Mórmon for tem months.  I was pleased.  I love to see the fruit of my labors and how The Lord hás blessed me throughout my mission.  I know, from experience, that The Savior hás the power to heal our shattered souls, to bind up the broken hearted, to cleanse the repentant soul, and I know by the witness of the Holy Ghost that He lives.  I know He is our Savior and is the very Son of God.  I love Him.  I love to serve Him.   This week our numbers were as follows;Bapt/conf.................................0/0Bapt marked.............................6/3Pesq na igr................................7Liç c membro............................11Novos........................................14Endereços..................................12Lemb s disto..............................96%Qualificar..................................100%  Have  a great week and a happy new year.

It will be interesting to leave the coast at last.  The furthest west of the coast I have ever been on my mission is forty miles.  The accent from paraná is hilarious.  I think Im going to have a fun time.  My Half companion(the other zone leader) is Elder Eliakim, who was my companion some seven or eight months ago in Florianópolis, and my official companion will be an american name E. Moody.  I hope his attitude dosnt reflect his name.  This will probably be my last área.  Today I finally broke down and bought a câmera.  I will send you some pictures next week or something.This week was na interesting one.

My half companion Elder Dewitt -the other zone leader- and I have been having some fun hunting cockroaches in his desk; its a yearly ritual down here, usually starting when the temperature gets above 95 degrees and continues through march.  One of the doorknobs in the house broke as well and refused disassemble, so we filmed E DeWitt break the door down.  The door frame was already somewhat damaged, so I suspect its not the first time this has happened.  I have discovered that longsleeve dress shirts can serve as good costume pieces for being a white ninja, arab, and many other things.  As you can all tell from these things, my mission is being very productive...         Being Christmas Eve, the brazilians usually have christmas supper at 1:00AM on the twenty fifth, and we are permitted to attend, but my companion and I opted to make our own dinner and sleep earlier and take advantage of the presidents permission to sleep in on christmas.  So I decided to make a pizza american style with a thick crust, the ever absent tomato sauce, never found on brazilian pizza, and a ton of mozzarella cheeze.  That is still on my schedule for tonight.  the ingredients were by no means cheap.          I look forward to talking to you all tomorrow, Ive been thinking about it all week.  I dont know if youll get this tonight or tommorow, but I hope you all have a merry christmas.  I love each one of you and pray for you every day.                 Love Joseph

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Happy Christmas...From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 15 Dec 2008 18:20:48 +0000           Dear Family,           This week was zone conference, and due to flooding in the north, we had seven of the tem zones of the mission there.  One hundred and ten missionaries together.  I havnt been with that many missionaries since the MTC!  We made a covenant with the Lord to have five baptisms for a Christmas to the Lord.  One of the things we agreed to do was loucuras(crazy things), like get up on the bus and preach and stuff like that.  I had a good week, conference was enjoyable and my following experiences were quite interresting.  After conference I went to Criciúma to do a baptismal interview and division.  It was me and Elder Cornaby.  We were comapnions in the MTC and it was good to see how much he hás grown.  I really miss serving with someone as humble and charitable as he is.  As we were waiting for the bus back to tubarão, we still had forty minutes and E Cornaby looked at me and Said, “vamos fazer uma loucura?”(shall we do something crazy?)  Well, we were in the bus station full of people, but I felt kind of nervous of how to go about preaching-what to say, how to start, etc- but I am a zone leader, so I felt like I had to be na example and at least pretend to be more determined.  If I couldnt do it, the rest of the zone wouldnt do it.  So we went out to one of the benches full of people, and Elder Cornaby stood there and started talking shyly with the same contact as we usally use with people.  No one really paid attention to him.  So we went inside, because I had no Idea what to do and I wanted to think up a way that we could do it more effectivly.  So we discussed how they must have done it anciently.  Get up and make some noise and seize some attention.  We Said a prayer and it came to my mind three scriptures; Amos 8:11-12, Mattew 5:6 and Matt 11:28-30.  Our new contact went somthing like this;   “Hey every body, we are representatives of Jesus Christ, and we have a quick message for you all.  In amos 8, the prophet amos spoke these words conscerning our days–then we read amos 8: 11-12- for centuries there have been people hungering and thirsting to know God, and have lived out their days searching for Him, but found it not, but the Lord also Said “blessed are those that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled” In mathew 11, Jesus Said, “comeunto me, all ye that are heavy laden and I shall give you rest..”(we read the rest of the scripture as well).  As representatives of Jesus Christ, our purpose is to help all people to come unto Christ, that their souls may be filled....”    After saying this we start getting adresses.  Afterward, Elder Cornaby looked at me with a smile and Said, “you know, Ive always wanted to do something like that, but I didnt know if we really could.”  I felt the same way.  We(this time E Brandão and I) did same thing on a bus ride here in tubarão.  I can say that it really gets peoples attention and the last time we did it, we got adresses from 50% of the people.  I am starting to wonder if we shouldnt do some baptismal invitations at the same time and add it into the end and just quote OurPurpose.  If we keep this up, we’ll have more adresses than we can contact.  We might as well see who really wants to come unto Christ instead of just getting a blessing.  I remember when we were in the MTC doing contacts.  We got five pass along cards to pass out on main street in São Paulo for two hours.  E. Cornaby and I were so nervous we cjouldnt hardly stop anyone.  I think we’ve changed alot.My companion is doing well aside from being sick for the last week.  As always, I am trying to help him speak out a little more. Our área is alright, though there are many people we teach who even after recieving an answer dont want to follow.  I got pretty down about it last night, after two great investigators in a row rejected the invitation to be baptized even though they knew it was true, but I remembered that Nephi(this being the one in third nephi) spoke so powerfully that no one could help but believe, and in the end, few followed.  It was the same with the priests of King Noah.  There is no way that they could not have believed Abinadi’s words. I really love being a missionary.  I want to do the best I possibly can.  I am glad that president told us to do some Loucuras.  I always felt that there could be a more effective way to go about doing missionary work than just knocking doors. I looked at the prices to call from here to the states, and its very expensive.  Its actually cheaper for you to call me than for the brazilians to call home just twelve ours away!  If you need to, you can take the money out of my personal account to pay for the phone call.  You can call me whenever you want, (only on Christmas of course) because  this number is my cell phone number.  I think last christmas you called me at 8 o clock your time and it was just about noon here.  I guess just dont call after six o clock your time.  To call me, the number is as follows;  011-55-48-8845-0183.  Thats 011-55-48-8845-0183.I love all of you and hope you all have a great Christmas vacation.Love, Elder Andrews

Queiroz,    I had a good week, conference was enjoyable and my following experiences were quite interresting.  After conference I went to Criciúma to do a baptismal interview and division.  It was me and Elder Cornaby.  We were comapnions in the MTC and it was good to see how much he hás grown.  I really miss serving with someone as humble and charitable as he is.  As we were waiting for the bus back to tubarão, we still had forty minutes and E Cornaby looked at me and Said, “vamos fazer uma loucura?”  Well, we were in the bus station full of people, but I felt kind of nervous of how to go about preaching-what to say, how to start, etc- but I am a zone leader, so I felt like I had to be na example and at least pretend to be more determined.  If I couldnt do it, the rest of the zone wouldnt do it.  So we went out to one of the benches full of people, and Elder Cornaby stood there and started talking shyly with the same contact as we usally use with people.  No one really paid attention to him.  So we went inside, because I had no Idea what to do and I wanted to think up a way that we could do it more effectivly.  So we discussed how they must have done it anciently.  Get up and make some noise and seize some attention.  We Said a prayer and it came to my mind three scriptures; Amos 8:11-12, Mattew 5:6 and Matt 11:28-30.  Our new contact went somthing like this;  “Hey every body, we are representatives of Jesus Christ, and we have a quick message for you all.  In amos 8, the prophet amos spoke these words conscerning our days–then we read amos 8: 11-12- for centuries there have been people hungering and thirsting to know God, and have lived out their days searching for Him, but found it not, but the Lord also Said “blessed are those that hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled” In mathew 11, Jesus Said, “comeunto me, all ye that are heavy laden and I shall give you rest..”(we read the rest of the scripture as well).  As representatives of Jesus Christ, our purpose is to help all people to come unto Christ, that their souls may be filled....”    After saying this we start getting adresses.  Afterward, Elder Cornaby looked at me with a smile and Said, “you know, Ive always wanted to do something like that, but I didnt know if we really could.”  I felt the same way.  We(this time E Brandão and I) did same thing on a bus ride here in tubarão.  I can say that it really gets peoples attention and the last time we did it, we got adresses from 50% of the people.  I am starting to wonder if we shouldnt do some baptismal invitations at the same time anda dd it into the end and just quote OurPurpose.  If we keep this up, we’ll have more adresses than we can contact.  We might as well see who really wants to come unto Christ instead of just getting a blessing.  I remember when we were in the MTC doing contacts.  We got five pass along cards to pass out on main street in São Paulo for two hours.  E. Cornaby and I were so nervous we cjouldnt hardly stop anyone.  I think we’ve changed alot.My companion is doing well aside from being sick for the last week.  As always, I am trying to help him speak out a little more. Our área is alright, though there are many people we teach who even after recieving an answer dont want to follow.

Sixteen years old...  I remember those days.  That was the best time for me.  When I come home He’ll be driving and dating.  We’re going to have a blast...    This week I have been studying about the role of the Book of Mórmon in conversion and consequently I have taken my effort to re read the Book of Mórmon again seriously and not let a day go by without reading a chapter at least.  Reading in chronological order may not be the best way to seek light and knowledge, but it does increase perspective and help you find things easier as you familiarize yourself with where everything is located.    Elder Brandão is doing all right, though I want to see him take a more active and assertive manner in teaching.  Its hard because sometimes its just easier to do things myself instead of waiting for him to do something.  He is very quiet and dosnt give much input in study, teaching, planning what we will teach, etc.  I wonder if he will miss me or not when we are split up.  He is doing well though.   Capivari de Baixo is as always difficult to work during the afternoon.  But we are teaching a family that is very, very good.  When we gave a blessing three weeks ago, it went perfectly.  The second visit was during the leadership counsel, so I was in Floripa and it was two green elders teaching.  The next visit we retaught the first lesson, and I felt like they might fall.  But this week when we came back, we taught about the plan of salvation and the importance of following the Savior by faith, repentance, baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost.  So I asked if they had any doubts or questions.  Terezinha, the mother, raised her hand and asked why baptism was so important, so we opened up to John 3;5 and explained that for them to get to the celestial kindom and have their family together, they would have to be baptized.  Sos he asked if her catholic baptism was valid.  I Said “você quer a resposta com açúcar ou sem açúcar?” (do you want the answer with sugar or without?) everbody laughed and she Said I could go ahead and just tell her, so I told her no.  When she asked why, I reminded her about the loss of authority with the death of the apostles, and then she started to say something but mid phrase she opened her eyes wide and Said “Oooh” as the connection clicked in her head.  From there, she told us of her search for the truth and I guess the rest will just be history.  Now we just need to get her husband to give up cachaça (an alcoholic drink that is pretty much 99.999999% alcohol) and we’ll be good.  We would be having a baptism this week, but it didnt work out with his work Schedule, so we moved the date to next Thursday.  This week as I Said a prayer before bed on Thursday, I was about to ask for the Lord to do something, but it occured to me that He dosnt ever really interfere and do that kind of work, like making someone go to church, read the book of mórmon, etc.  the answers to many of our prayers are what we and others do.  It is I that must help the people to do all this.  When the people follow my invitations to act, then and only then can the Lord do His part and let the spirit get in their hearts and make the cahnges.  I am glad to be a missionary and learn how to really get things done the Lord’s way through the grunt work and not just talking in front of a bunch of sypathisers in church.   I love you all and hope you have a great week.  We’ll be tlking to you here in a couple of weeks...                            Love, Joseph

I asked Elder Brandão what number he thought would be good, and he Said seven.  Thats alot for one month, and its rather ambitious, so I wanted to make sure he wasnt just popping out a high number to show bravado, so I asked him what he thinks we need to do to accomplish it.  He Said we just have to find two families and another person.  So we put our goal down and put out what we need to do to succeed.  It was a good experience.  One of those families we found last Sunday was elect.  It was hard to get a hold of them all together to teach the restoration, and we did finally get them together on Saturday night at nine o clock at night.  As I looked at my watch I wondered if we should just mark another day and run home, but I didnt want to lose the chance to teach the lesson.  I didnt know what to do and nothing came to mind of what we could teach them so I decided to just say a prayer and take it from there.  During the prayer I felt as though we could go ahead and teach the lesson.  So we did and marked their baptism for the twentieth because they couldnt make it to church on Sunday this week.  When I Said the date, the husband (Sidney) asked we what time the baptismal meeting would start, so that he could ask off work.  Wow.  We managed to get a ride home from some members to whom we expressed ALOT of thanks.  We are trying to do all that is possible to have a good follow up with our good investigators.  One of our agreements with the Lord is that we will teach at least 30 lessons a week, and we Just barely managed to do it on Sunday.  On Wednesday we went up to Capivari de Baixo and during the evening, I  had a strong feeling;  “Go find somebody”.  So instead of trying to teach someone that just wont progress, we went on a contacting frenzy.  I dont know what it was, but I felt an absolute need to find somebody, and not justa any body, but someone that was needing us and our message.  I felt my testimony burning within me and I felt a desire to talk to what ever soul entered our path.  So I did.  It was already about the time that the bus passes to go back to tubarão, and I even saw a bus coming by,  and was tempted to get on, but I felt the impression, “just one more person”, so we kept going and found a house with a senhora and her daughter, both of which are single and I felt that they were needing the message, so in preparation for the blessing, I focused alot on how our families can be together forever.  I dont know if they are divorced or widows or what, but I guess we’ll see when we go back on this Wednesday.  On Thursday, we found a widow who is probably about 50 and who had lost her husband some six years ago.  As I gave a blessing, I felt her husbands presence, and that he wanted very much to have his work done.  I didnt say anything about this to her naturally, but I did say to my companion after wards that I thought that her husband wanted her to accept the Gospel.  The next time we went there, we taught the second lesson with a sister from the ward who helped out alot.  I told the woman –Terezinha- that if she wanted to have her family together again, she should be baptized, and her answer was a little unsure, especially due to her past negative experiences going  to assembléia with her son.  She Said that after going there she cant sleep at night and feels flat out bad because they never say good things there.  So we will plan a FHE with the sisters family and try to integrate her and teach her the 1st lesson.  I wont let her go without first giving alot of exhortatinos and talking aobut the consequences of not following the Savior.  Some Elders think that since people have agency they can just choose what theyll do.  Thats true, but at the last day, theyre going to look at me during judgment and tell me you idiot, you just let me say no and walk away?!  Why didnt you tell me   this would happen?”  Sure we told them and taught them, and sure maybe we rid our garments of their blood, but our job isnt to rid our garments of their blood and put it on theirs.  It  needs to be on the Saviors garments.  Thats our mission.  So Its worth it to exhort, burn and advise.  All in all, we had a good week.    Elder Brandão has really started to loosen up now and as we put our goals togther We got to feel more comfortable talking to each other about how we can improve.  He is finally starting to give input and critique, instead of just following quietly and even interrupts and makes additions to what I say in lessons to bear testimony and teach.  I feel so much better now.  I like to be equals with my companions and grow together.   Our áreas are going well, though there seems to be some issues about lunches in Capivari.  Were getting it figured out though.  I have studied alot about conversion and the differences between testimony and conversion.  The apostle Peter had a testimony, revealed by the Holy Ghost that Jesus was the Christ the Son of the living God, yet the Savior Said to him, “when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren.  Conversion, or spiritual rebirth is not permanant.  Just as every being Born into this world needs nourishment three times a day for it to be healthy and live, every person spiritually re Born needs to have spiritual nourishment.  We can lose our conversion through sin, and our spiritual rebirth can be lost through spiritual death and we can no longer walk in the “newness of life”.  I discovered this week that there are two ways in which we may lose our conversion;  Spiritual poison,-sin- which induces spiritual death immediatly, and spritual malnutrition, which is a gradual and painful process.  Those who “hunger and thirst after righteousness shall be filled”, and nutrifying their souls through obedience to the ordinances of the gospel, they shall bel ed to the Fount of all righteousness.  Thank goodness for repentance.  I love the gospel and love the Lord.  What a blessing it is to be His servant. Our numbers this week were as follows;Bapt/conf................................0/0Bapt mark...............................7/4Pesq na igr...............................5Liç c memb.............................13Novos.......................................25Endereços................................44Lemb se dist............................91%Qualificar.................................100%Have na excellent week and thank you for all you do to help us.

Its looking like its not going to be an option for me.  However, maybe I can plan on coming out for memorial day or something...   Heres an update on weather in Santa Catarina, Brazil;  RAIN  It hás rained non stop for the last eternity.  Someone asked me this week if we get off when it rained.  I told them that if we did, we would have had the whole last month off without having to work one single day.  The week passed by well enough.  The rain slowed down our progress a little bit, along with the rest of the zone, but the zone had several baptisms to account for.  So that was good.  During the Leadership Counsel I learned a great deal, and I got some ideas to help me and my companion work better together.  Elder DeWitt and I spent the majority of Saturday traveling to Criciúma to give a zone meeting and even further south to Araranguá for a baptismal interview.  As a result of this combined with the rain, our numbers suffered.  On Saturday night, as we were planning, I looked at the Schedule for Sunday afternoon and felt like we should try to find some new people and knock some doors in São João, and it was almost as if I could picture the exact área in which we needed to knock.  So last night we turned up a little alley that ive noticed in the past and knocked some doors.  The first family that we gave a blesing tôo there was fantastic.  They were chock full of questions about why there exist so many churches and already know one of the good members of the ward here.  I saw that they had a guitar, so I asked if I could sing a hymn, to which they Said yes.  I played and sang “Onde há Amor” –where love is there God is also- and when I finished one of the elderly ladies was in tears already, and we gave the blessing.  It was good.  They told us that this was exactly what they were needing and God had sent us at the right moment.  As they Said that, I remembered how I had felt like we needed to go there that day.  We found yet another Young family who upon being asked if they’d like to recieve a blessing responded with a firm yes.  Upon asking them that if Jesus Christ showed them the way to follow to have their family together in eternity, if He showed them would they follow? They Said yes firmly and without hesitation.  And upon telling them about a mesage that would show them how to have the feelings of the spirit forever they Said yes.  Every time they Said it, you could tell they really meant it.   My companion is doing fine and I am trying to help him grow and teach better.  I told him how I felt in the beginning of my mission about desiring to bear testimony of everything and that whenever he wanted, he could bump me and speak up.  He dosnt really participate a whole lot.  When thinking about it, when we come out of the MTC and hearing about how we shouldnt memorize lessons, we still have the memorized mentality of teaching principles and switching off every so many parts with a memorized pattern.  Our message is baisically broken down into four parts though; 1st the plan of Salvation and thats the “Why” to everything; 2nd how we follow Jesus Christ, this being the Gospel of Jesus Christ with faith, repentance baptism and recieving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and 4th what the commandments of God are.  You can easily fit all four of those in any given lesson with the focus being on what ever the needs of the investigator are.  I’m really starting to like resolving people’s concerns or doubts.  I am trying to teach E. Brandão how to do it tôo.  We’ll see how well I succeed.     My half companion (the other zone leader who lives with us) E. DeWitt is from Arizona and pretty much hás convinced me to go out and visit him in Gilbert when I come home.  I guess that Works out just perfectly seeing Rebecca and Jason live out there in AZ tôo.  Well I hope all continues well and you dont get as much rain as we are getting down here.  Theres alot of flooding and land slides going on here.                      Love, Elder Andrews

So last night we turned up a little bico that ive noticed in the past and knocked some doors.  The first family that we gave a blesing tôo there was fantastic.  They were chock full of questions about why there exist so many churches and already know one of the good members of the ward here.  I saw that they had a guitar, so I asked if I could sing a hymn, to which they Said yes.  I played and sang “Onde há Amor” –where love is there God is also- and when I finished one of the elderly ladies was in tears already, and we gave the blessing.  It was good.  They told us that this was exactly what they were needing and God had sent us at the right moment.  As they Said that, I remembered how I had felt like we needed to go there that day.  We found yet another Young family who upon being asked if they’d like to recieve a blessing responded with a firm yes.  Upon asking them that if Jesus Christ showed them the way to follow to have their family together in eternity, if He showed them would they follow? They Said yes firmly and without hesitation.  And upon telling them about a mesage that would show them how to have the feelings of the spirit forever they Said yes.  Every time they Said it, you could tell they really meant it.  My companion is doing fine and I am trying to help him grow and teach better.  I told him how I felt in the beginning of my mission about desiring to bear testimony of everything and that whenever he wanted, he could bump me and speak up.  He dosnt really participate a whole lot.  When thinking about it, when we come out of the MTC and hearing about how we shouldnt memorize lessons, we still have the memorized mentality of teaching principles and switching off every so many parts with a memorized pattern.  Our message is baisically broken down into four parts though; 1st the plan of Salvation and thats the “Why” to everything; 2nd how we follow Jesus Christ, this being the Gospel of Jesus Christ with faith, repentance baptism and recieving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and 4th what the commandments of God are.  You can easily fit all four of those in any given lesson with the focus being on what ever the needs of the investigator are.  I’m really starting to like resolving people’s concerns or doubts.  I am trying to teach E. Brandão how to do it tôo.  We’ll see how well I succeed.    Tommorow in companionship study Elder Brandão and I will put the new method of making goals into practice.  It wont be easy, but I have faith that it can work.  We will be doing a zone meeting on the fourth and fifth to follow up on the zones success and usage of the program.  I think this transfer will be alot better than the last.  Thank you for all you do to help us and you and Sister Queiroz’s tireless efforts to help the mission grow.  Our prayers are with you.  Our sad numbers this week are as follows:Bapt/conf....................................0/0Bapt marked................................8/4Pesq na igr...................................2Liç c memb..................................8Novos...........................................21Endereços.....................................20Lemb se disto...............................96%Qualificar.....................................100%

I think the majority of the people we wanted to teach were at the beach.  Its kind of funny how we pray for the rain to go away and when it gets sunny again, we pray for rain.  My companion is starting to open up a little bit and I am finally starting to understand his slangs from Bahia.  All my companions for the last year of my mission have been from São Paulo, so I think Ive only gotten accostomed to hear souther and Paulista slangs.  Elder Brandão is also starting to give a little more of his opinion on how we should work, so I am starting to really like working with him.  Elder Brough once told me that companionship makes all the difference.  It does.  As we were in the baptism of one of our investigators this week, E. Brandão looked at me and whispered “This makes number two!”  Up until then, I hadnt really thought much about how he was feeling about his success in his mission.  I’ve just been concentrating on getting more baptisms in general and had not even stopped to think of how many baptisms he already hás.  He told me that every one Said that his mission would be spent in the mall, or playing around or something, because no one baptizes around here.  As he told me, he gave a laugh.  Im glad that even though as a trainer I havnt gotten the highest numbers, I have shown him that we can focus on and achieve baptisms.  If all góes according to plan, we should have another baptism this Saturday for Capivari de Baixo.  This Saturday, I asked E. Brandão what he thought of the day (not alot had happened that day) and he Said he thinks its great that we are getting baptisms and having success, but we can do much, much more.  So I repented and decided to do much, much more.  Yesterday we went to Capivari for the afternoon and still had an appointment in Tubarão, so the bus Schedule was a little tight.  We had arranged for a lesson to take place in a members house, but the investigator –the one who is supposed to be baptized on Saturday- wasnt home, so that fell through.  So we went to catch the bus and while we were walking, the phone rang and it was the member calling to say that the investigator had arrived and she was marking for us to come back on Wednesday.  Right after I hung up the phone, I heard my companion say “there góes the bus” and start to laugh.  It would be another half na hour for another bus to come by and he Said that it didnt leave time for us to really get anything done but wait at the bus stop.  I told him “oh yeah?” and called up the sister and asked for her to keep the investigator there and wait for us.  So we gave a revised lesson on the restoration and got out of there with a tem minute walk to the bus stop ahead and five minutes to get there.  So I prayed.  And I prayed.  And I remembered Elder Ellis talk about our part, and walked faster.  And faster.  I prayed first for us to get the bus.  Then I prayed that the bus would be just slow enough for us to get there on time.  And then I prayed for us to be able to walk fast enough to get there on time.  As we aproached the intersection where we would turn to get to the bus stop –and consequently where the bus would pass by- I felt like I needed to go faster.  So I walked faster, and then I felt like I needed to run, so I ran to the intersection, and just as I got there to my right the bus was showing up, so I waved for it to stop, but it just went by, and so we ran like there was no tomorrow to get to the bus stop.  If we had been any slower, even by one second, we would have missed the bus and lost the appointment.  We got the bus, and consequently got to our teaching appointment on time.  There was nobody home.  But thats ok because  we found someone else who will probably get baptized.  As I was catching my breath on the bus, I Said a prayer of gratiutude for the answered prayers.  I was sure that there was someone laughing with us up there at our little adventure and lesson on how to “Pedir”, and “Lutar” for an answer.  We repented of running and risking injuries, so dont worry.   I enjoyed Elder Ellis’ visit and learned alot and we are trying to seek out more revelation.  It isnt easy, but I think it is worth it.  This week wasnt a week to be proud of with numbers, but next week should be better.  Our numbers this week are as follows:Bapt/conf..........................1/1Bapt marcados..................7/4Pesq na reunião.................4Liç c membro....................13Novos pesq........................18Endereços..........................17Lemb s dist........................96%Qualificar..........................100%Thank you for all you do.

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Joy be unto you, o andrews family; a letter from JosephFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 10 Nov 2008 16:21:56 +0000Dear Family,   This morning, after a long night of troubled sleep due to mosquitos, I decided to go on a mad mosquito hunt.  Armed with an electric fan and a flip flop sandal, I got the air moving under beds and desks where they like to hide out during the day and discovered that there exists an abundance of mosquitos in Brasil.  The casualties among the enemies were over fourteen.  And that was just in our room.  Tonight we will close the door and Windows and sleep in perfect peace... Im hearing all kinds of different input from everyone about Obama.  The brazilians all worship him, mostly because the medias standpoint is based only on the sypathisers of the democrats.  I practically never found out who was running against him.    I got to do a division this week with the Elders from Criciúma and it was a blast.  The district leader down there is Elder Cornaby, my companion from the MTC, so it was good to see how much he hás grown.  I got to watch him give a district meeting and it was good to see how much he hás matured since being in the field.  I remember our first morning as missionaries, as we got off the plane and went into the MTC in São Paulo.  There were so many cool and prepared looking missionaries that I thought it would be cool to be companions with.  When they were calling out he companions, and they Said Elder Andrews and Elder Cornaby, I looked at him; he had the look of a child from primary in shock at being a missionary, open mouthed and smiling.  I thought “Oh no.  Its going to be a looooong 62 days...”  I love E. Cornaby.  He is perfectly humble and hás perfect charity.  I also got to eat lunch at one of my converts form Criciúmas house.  It was a good division.   This week I tried to get two people who had almost been baptized a couple of times this last year to get baptized, but it didnt work.  As we taught them, the spirit wasnt as strong as I had intended it to be, so they didnt want to change or accept the invitation.  The next day we went to another investigators house who we didnt succeed in following up on and I didnt feel anthing, so I started to get a little down and lose confidence.  So we stoppeed by a members house so I could pray and think of what we could do next.  We left not knowing what to do, so I figured we should just knock doors.  I remembered what president Queiroz told me in his reply to my email last week about trusting in the Lord and the new techniques and so we pressed on and found three families to start teaching, one of which we marked to visit today to teach the first lesson.  Its been a while since I got a good feeling about the people we bless and I felt MUCH better upon leaving.  The power of the priesthood is real and helps us to bring hte spirit.   My companion is doing well, I am trying to think of how I can help him to grow and to trust in him more.  Sometimes I want to just hear his testimony and see if he feels what he says, but Ill just wait.  He is a very closed person, and I hope to be able to help him open up a little bit.  I will work on communicating with him a little more as we go on this week. Interresting things are happening as we continue to go to Capivari de Baixo.  People are giving us plenty of refferences and we are doing our best to contact them.  I need to get a hold of some investigators and get a baptismal date marked.  As always, following up remains the all time champion of obstacles in our work.  I have been wanting to meet with the bishop in São João and present a plan in regards to this involving ward missionaries inviting small groups of investigators to be taught simple priciples such as faith repentance and baptism.  I looked at the examples of Peters 3000 converts, Almas 204, Ammons 14000, King benjamins entire people, and of the 2500 of the Savior in bountiful.  Those who feel the spirit together feel unity, hence the importance of spiritual activities in a families every day life.  In the five cases listed above, the people more or less had “all things in common”.  If I can succeed in getting ward missionaries to give small lessons in their own homes and in the homes of investigators, we can succeed in getting more people in church and to progress together as well as caring for one another.  This would involve having a firm ward mission leader to give training and alot of work from members.  All this would go in as formatted in Almas plans listed in Mosiah 18, seeing as he too had serious obstacles with following up(if he came into town, he was toast).  People had to get together more than once a week(the appointed day) “as much as it were possible”.    We managed to mark six more baptisms this week and four of them have a possibility of being baptized in the next two or three weeks.  Ill have to break my back over getting that done, but Im more or less absolutley positive itll be worth it.  I remember when I turned sênior in february, and how I focused on finding people to teach and fill up our days.  I succeeded.  It was a bad week if we had less than thirty five new investigators and forty lessons with a member present, or less than fourteen people in church.  We only baptized four people though.  Im focusing more now on who we can baptize now rather than who we can teach and at least for now, it seems that the future is smiling brightly before us.  We will have a baptism on thrusday and if we work our cards right and actually manage to get in the desired follow ups, one more towards the end of the week.  We’ll see.     I love each of you and I pray for your saftey and well being.  Have a good week.        Love Elder Andrews

After my fast last week, I had been feeling a little more optomistic, but as the week slowly passed by, I got a little stressed for lack of being able to contact and follow up with some of our investigators, and on Thursday we went up to Capivari to keep some appointments and then hurry back to tubarão to teach a family.  All of our appointments fell through and it turrned out to be a waste of time and money for passage.  As we just barely caught the bus to get back I was feeling kind of down and I thought that the family we were on our way to visit who is inactive ando n the way to activity again would want to wait to baptize their daughter untill the dad was able to do it and it would probably take a long time, so I was a little down hearted.  So I Said a prayer and asked for the baptisms I have been requesting and working to get for the last transfer.  We got to the familys house and they Said they wanted to baptize their 10 year old daughter on Friday.  That was a surprize, but we threw the baptism together and prepared everything in a ridiculously short amount of time and it turned out very well.  The Lord answers our prayers, even if it is in ways unsought.  My companion is doing alright.  He seems to be a little more shy about doing contacts and taking course in teaching, so Im going to put a little more pressure on him and invite him to plan out how he can help the investigators make and keep commitments.  He started to say some things about the United States that were less than positive to say the least and I got a little defensive.  I told him that if he wants to have success in the mission, he should never say anything bad about the place from where his companion is from.  I have already had a companion that just talked badly about the states to try to beat me into submission and though I tried to overcome my pride and just let it go by, it just put animosity between us.  It really had a negative effect on us both and especially on our work.  So I warned my compmanion about that for the future.  He is a good missionary and I need to think of how I can help him leearn all that he should know and do.  Our personalities are quite different, but we can make it if I plan out how I can help him in any way. We went to the cemetery yesterday to find new people and at first I was having limited success in getting poeples adresses, until I figured out that if, upon mentioning eternal families I asked them if they wanted to be with their families forever, they Said yes and we could offer the opportunity to them with a message and a blessing.

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: TOP SECRET- update from Tubarao (the shark)From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 3 Nov 2008 16:09:26 +0000Dear family, we finally managed to get a baptism down here.  Its my first baptism since april.  After my fast last week, I had been feeling a little more optomistic, but as the week slowly passed by, I got a little stressed for lack of being able to contact and follow up with some of our investigators, and on Thursday we went up to Capivari to keep some appointments and then hurry back to tubarão to teach a family.  All of our appointments fell through and it turrned out to be a waste of time and money for passage.  As we just barely caught the bus to get back I was feeling kind of down and I thought that the family we were on our way to visit who is inactive ando n the way to activity again would want to wait to baptize their daughter untill the dad was able to do it and it would probably take a long time, so I was a little down hearted.  So I Said a prayer and asked for the baptisms I have been requesting and working to get for the last transfer.  We got to the familys house and they Said they wanted to baptize their 10 year old daughter on Friday.  That was a surprize, but we threw the baptism together and prepared everything in a ridiculously short amount of time and it turned out very well.  The Lord answers our prayers, even if it is in ways unsought.     We went to the cemetery yesterday to find new people and at first I was having limited success in getting poeples adresses, until I figured out that if, upon mentioning eternal families I asked them if they wanted to be with their families forever, they Said yes and we could offer the opportunity to them with a message and a blessing.  We got quite a few adresses as well as the others in our zone.  At this point, the hardest part of our work and the greatest hinderance to our succes is in a lack of follow ups.  I have been thinking of implementing a plan (this being especially neccessary seeing our adoption of Capivari) in which the ward missionaries and even perhaps other investigators take care of investigators and help each other progress.  When poeple feel the Spirit together, they feel charity for each other, hence the commandment to meet together oft and even more importantly the importance of seeking the spirit as a family.

It brought back the memories of when I was a priest and blessed the sacrament.  I love to do it, and act in the name of the Savior.  Truly, when we go to church seeking to feel the spirit of God, we shal ever surely find it.  I am ever so greatful to be a member of the church of Jesus Christ and have the opportunity to hold His Priesthood.   Well Dad, President Queiroz hás been putting the heat on the zone leaders to start baptizing or else...  So I was thinking about this baptism and how perhaps we could maybe turn it into two if we played our cards right, so when president called this week after getting back from a traing with Elder Scott, I took advantage to ask him what he thought.  He told me that he would leave it up to me to decide, because “if you cant learn to make your own decisions, youll never learn to be a good leader.  You guys have the keys, so Ill just sustain whatever you and your companion decide to do.  But dont worry Elder Andrews, if I disagree, Ill just boot you down to Junior Companion again...”  to which he started to laugh.  I told him thanks for the reassurance.  I like our president and I am glad to be serving under him.  I hope your week góes well and remember that I love all of you.  I really miss my nieces adn nephews too.                              Love Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Happy Haloween!From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 27 Oct 2008 14:01:06 +0000Dear family,       This week was a week in which I could grow, learn, excercise more faith and see the hand of the Lord in our work.  At the beginning of the transfer, I did a fast on fast sunday and requested of the Lord to let me have five baptisms this transfer.  So I put a list together of people that have potencial to be baptized or that were set to be baptized during the transfer.  We had a baptism set up for last saturday, but it fell through when the boys father wouldnt let him be baptized.  His family is inactive and said that they didnt think he was prepared sufficiently.  A bunch of other plans seemed to be falling through as well, and so I did a fast yesterday to be able to succeed with my goal of baptisms.  Two hours after starting the fast, we convinced Rodrigo, the father of the boy whose baptism fell through, to let his son be baptized and start coming back to church.  Yesterday I went to church in Capivari de Baixo and left my companion to take care of our ward.  I felt that probably he wouldnt be able to count all of the investigators in church because he doesnt know them all, but oh well.  When I got to the branch in Capivari with irmao Dilney, I recieved three references and a request to visit a less active family who wants to baptize their ten year old son.  When I got back, Elder Brandao said that three people went to church who said that they want to be baptized, people that I had never even met before.  After I broke my fast, I kind of got some kind of determination to follow through with people to help them keep their commitments to be baptized.  The first time I trained, we had ridiculously high numbers and I thought we were having success, but in retrospect, we just managed to teach a bunch of people while only baptizing four in two transfers.  Now, when I mark baptisms, I have a sincere desire and a determiniation to help the people get baptized.  Upon conversing with my companion, weve decided to mark baptisms in two weeks to help us and our investigators focus.  Alot of the time we just mark baptisms for numbers, knowing that probably the people wont really get baptized on the appointed date.  But now I want to help people gain a testimony and act on it getting baptized.  All in all the fast helped me out.        My companion is doing well and yesterday I let him take some of the harder parts of teaching the first lesson and I must say, he did an excellent job.  He is opening up little by little, and is starting to give input on how we can improve, or especially me, but thats OK, because I can see that he is willing to open up a little.  He seems to be doing all right with the rules, and never asks questions, so I just have to guess what he might need help with.  He'll loosen up one of these days.         Our area is doing well and the members trust us and like to help us out when they can.  Capivari is doing alot better now with a new person responsible for the branch.  Irmao Dilney is an outstanding leader and is helping to tie up loose ends and get all the people reactivated.  His wife is also a returned missionary so she is quite capable to help out in the branch as well.  I think there would be no problem in sending a couple of missionaries there.  The members are giving references and the people there are good people.        That sounds pretty funny about wearing mis-matching shoes.  I suppose it would be even worse if one were wing tipped and the other capped.  I dont know if there was any dancing at the reception, but if someone cracked a joke, at least you could say you dont have two left feet...          There was only one day in the last two weeks that we saw the sun; it just rained, and rained, and rained, and rained,and rained, and rained, and rained,and rained, and rained, and rained,and rained, and rained, and rained....  We had our interviews with President Queiroz this week and it went well.  I suppose theres not really a whole lot to tell about this week.        Im glad to hear that Paul Paul is going on a mission to South America, we'll be more or less close for five months...        I love you all and hope you have a sumamente otimo semana, ate que voces tenham alegria infinita por causa de comer tanto doce!              Love Joseph

We went up to Capivari this Wednesday and found several people which were willing to be baptized.  We ate lunch at the relief society presidents house and she gave us some referrals, one of which we didnt succeed in getting into that day, but we went to the other one who góes to Assembly of God, who hás lost several of her children over the years (she is in her sixties) and we asked her if she wanted to be with her family again forever.  She Said yes.  So we asked her if she had faith in Jesus Christ.  She Said yes.  So we gave her a blesing and she felt the spirit and was even crying afterward and then we asked if she would give her tv to have her family again forever, to which she responded afirmativly as well as the questions if she would give her car, or house etc.  So we told her that Jesus Christ wants none of that, but that He wants her to be baptized.  She Said to us that she was already baptized to which we Said that we would explain later, but we wanted to know if she would follow the feelings she was feeling by the spirit.  And she accepted.  We also found an alcoholic woman who apparently had recieved the elders a long Time ago but never decided to change.  We gave her a blessing and gave her the invitation to act upon her feeling of the Holy Ghost and be baptized giving up her drinking and she Said she would and that it was time to change.  We could see the sincerity of what she Said in her eyes and marked the baptism for Sunday.  When we got back on Saturday, she had completly given up drinking even though her ex-husband gave her 40R$ for alcohol.  We found out that irmã Lucia, the president of the relief society who was with us when we gave the blessing and baptismal invitation had visited her four times over the weekend and that Meri, the investigator was excited and looking forward to her baptism.  Now she also hás to stop smoking, but she is progressing.  It was good to see that the members want ot help out.  After we got out of the house and blessing, irmã Lucia started asking how we could baptize her husband and this person or that and she was REALLY enthusiastic about the way we do our work.  I think taking the missionaries out of Capivari was a good thing and is helping the members value the missionary work and being a member as well.  Here in a couple of weeks it should be reopening again.  Elder Silva and I have enjoyed this transfer as we both have learned and grown together.  Im going to get to train again while continuing as a zone leader.  President Queiroz is doing some drastic changes and hás decided the age of every body training is over so only the good missionaries will train, and more than once tôo.  He also Said that if the zone leaders dont start baptizing, he’ll get the new missionaries and rent a hotel and train them till they can be his leaders.  No pressure there...  we’re all sweating bullets.  My new companion is from Bahia up north of Brazil.   Elder Silva is exciterd to go to a new área and get some baptisms as well.  I am rather daunted with the responsibility of training again, but with the Lords help, I can succeed.    Our área is going well and yesterday in our comp. study E. Silva and I decided that we have a new extremely high level of teaching and finding, but we need to be have a higher level of follow up with investigators.  Ive been studying the stories of Alma the Older, Peter and his 3000 converts, King Benjamins people and of those who Jesus taught and blessed in Bountiful.  There are several key points that Ive percieved;  1st)  They were taught in large groups.  2nd) none of them fell away.  3rd) they always took a special covenant to serve those who converted with them and have all things in common.  And 4th) they all had a mighty change of heart.  I find it interresting that they were all taught in large groups, be it in each others homes, forests, temples etc.  I am thinking of doing something like that here with my new companion and see if we can use our own investigators to do follow up and use each other to progress and “never fall away”.  Thats open to commentary.  With only seven months left, Im getting frantic to do the best I can and make the most of the second half of my mission.  The last six months really flew by.  I foud out that the family whose son was killed and over whom I worked so hard that I was teaching in Florianópolis got baptized this Saturday.  I cried out for joy and Im glad the elders there are working well with the people I taught. I know the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints the true church of God and His Son, built on Prophets seers and revelators who speak with and know Christ.  The power of  the Priesthood is real.  I know that Jesus Christ lives and is our savior.  I love to serve Him and hope that I can become a better servant to Him.  I love you, pray for you and hope that all contiues well at home.  I dont know what things are like up there, but all the banks here are on strike for some reason or other.  I havnt the slightest Idea on what all this economic crisis is, but it sure seems serious.                    Love, Joseph

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: an epsitle unto the illustrious family AndrewsFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 20 Oct 2008 16:39:03 +0000 Dear Family,  This week hás been interresting as I’ve begun training again.  My new companion, Elder Brandão is pretty cool, he’s from a state on the majority of the east coast called Bahia.  Most brazilians say that people from there are kind of lazy, or at least really slow, but my companion is doing a good job, though he dosnt seem all that talkative.  Im working on that one.  Usually when missionaries leave the MTC, they are pretty serious and boring, and we have to give them an Idea of how we can still have fun and work at the same time.  For instance;  singing in the midst of an everlasting warm front at the top of your lungs, walking through the puddles of water because its probably more dry when youre walking in the water,  barking at stray dogs to watch them freak out and start running from the invisible dog, etc.  I have to teach him the new techniques as well, so its kind of like teaching a missionary who didnt even pass through the MTC at all, and I think hes kind of doubtfull as to their inspiredness, so we’ve still got some work to do.  I like him though and Im sure he’ll be a great missionary.    So I’m a zone leader together with E. DeWitt from Gilbert AZ, but we’re not companions, we just live in the same house and are both training.  Its alot of fun.  Its the first time in my mission that Ive lived in the same house with an american.  Ive gotten to pull my english off the shelf and use and hear some words I havnt heard in forever. I decided to buy a new suit for 50$ to replace my one of my wool ones.  My suits were ridiculously hot last Summer and I dont want to die.  I gave a talk yesterday at church, for which Ihad a week to prepare, and I prepared, only I forgot my notes and stuff that I had carefully translated over the week, so as we were in Sunday school (its before sacrament meeting here), I got an Idea to talk about unity and the importance to go to church and feel the spirit in groups.  I have been studying very carefully about the effects of people being taught and converted in groups as shown in acts 2, mosiah 18 and alma 5, mosiah 2-5, and the story of the nephites taught in boutniful by the savior.  Every result was complete conversion until the end and “they had all things in common”.  President Eyring spoke about being united and giving fast offerings and other offerings to the poor and needy, and Said that it is directly affects how much of the gifts, and fruit of the Spirit we recieve.  Our mission president once Said that when talking about Zion, and how there was no poor among them, it doesnt mean that they all recieved the same amount of money.  For example, If I give $1000 to three people and come back in a week, one might have $3000, another, might have nothing, and another might actually owe me $1000.  So the question we need to ask is not “well, if we were all rich...”, but “how do I manage myself and how can I care for others in a way that they will not go hungry?”  Looking further, we see that when we feel the spirit, or especially when we feel the spirit as a result of remission of sin(Moroni 8:25-26), we feel Charity towards our peers.  When this happens in a group, all may feel this and may be converted and care one for another.  Is it any wonder that we need to begin worship in a closely knit such as the family?  When the family prays, and especially as Pres. Eyring described a family who even a Young child prayed for each and every one in the circle in such a way that the spirit descended and blessed all present; when they pray together and progress, they form a mini-Zion, and can be blessed accordingly.  I am working on a plan to keep up retention and follow ups with investigators based on the program in Mosiah 18 using ward missionaries in the place of priests.  I ll write more about that next week after I present the plan to the bishop.   I love you all, and this last week I remembered and naturally missed my nieces and nephews.  I hope they are well.  I pray for you and hope you are all doing well.  I got the letter from Gma Woodbury and Im happy to know she is well.  I had been thinking about her and Said a prayer for her earlier this week.  Im glad to hve blessed with such a wonderful family.                          Love, Joseph

We also noticed that the things Elder Americo showed us about making an invitation to be baptized in the first visit when we give a blessing makes it easier to find people to be baptized and saves us roughly 50% of wasted time on follow up visits and teaching people who wont really get baptized.  We still have some people who are marked for baptism, but who in all reality wont be baptized on those days.  We decided to exclude them in our numbers of people marked for baptism and try to get a an actual number of people with solid dates for baptism.  Naturally, our numbers for marked baptisms falls.  We also noted that if we apply the stuff Elder Americo introduced, new investigators will fall in numbers, because new investigators are those who are taught a lesson and accept a marked day for another visit.  If they don’t accept baptism, we don’t mark another visit.  Elder Silva and I agree that this could really increase the number of baptisms if we have more faith, really have the spirit as we give a blessing and have developed personal power.  We talked about the new things going on in the mission in the correlation meeting with the bishop here on Sunday, and he likes the idea and wants to start pumping up the ward mission and prepare for retention with a whole lot of new converts.  He seems excited.  I’m glad he supports us and isn’t worried about how he might handle a situation of having a lot of new members to take care of.  Some would just complain and say that we don’t care about retention and how we’re just making a problem for the bishop, but he sees it as a chance to get to work.  I like the ward here.   Elder Silva is doing well and I really am enjoying serving with someone so willing to try out new things and always improve together.  He seems to always know what to do.  On Saturday, we went on a couple of visits and gave blessings.  We used the new stuff we learned on Friday in conference and it felt kind of like a crash course or a 1000 meter dash blindfolded in a dark forest with low branches, but we pulled it off after calling Elder Americo four or five times in an hour and a half, looking for a little advice and working out the kinks here and there.  It turned out well.  We blessed a woman who lost her leg a few weeks ago to diabetes and who has four children living and five that passed away as children for various reasons and who also smokes.  I had no idea what to do or how to give the invitation to baptism, or whatnot, so I asked to use the restroom and I knelt down and prayed for guidance.  I don’t even remember what all I said, but I said a bunch of things about the plan for our families and gave a blessing.  Now that I think about it, I think I could have worded everything better, but we gave a blessing that she would be able to stop smoking.  It was a powerful blessing and the spirit was strong.  They, or especially the husband, said no to baptism.  Then we went to another person who had an issue with smoking and was depressed.  So we asked her, “if Jesus Christ cures you and takes away your desire to smoke, will you follow him and be baptized on the twenty fifth of October?”  She and her husband said yes.  We gave them blessings and the next day when we went to visit them, she said that she has no desire to smoke, that even the smell has lost it’s favor.  It almost seems easier to ask people to be baptized this way.  They exercise faith, making a commitment, based on their belief, and in the same hour, they receive a confirmation of their faith, and it’s easier for them to just do it and be baptized.  We want our whole zone to start doing this as well, and surely it will be the main focus in our zone meetings.  We have other experiences to tell, but it suffices to just say that we are, really, the representatives of Jesus Christ and we hold His priesthood and I am ever happy to be His servant.

We have two people preparing to be baptized on Sunday and we hope to find new people to teach and baptize.  This week I have been studying in the scriptures on how we can help people make and keep commitments.  I decided to read about the faith and resulting success of all the miracle workers listed in Ether twelve, starting in  Helaman chapter 5, about Nephi and Lehi and how they converted and changed the hearts of the lamanites and were baptized with fire and the Holy Ghost as a result.  I noticed a pattern.  Upon seeing a heavenly manifestation, their attitudes changed, and upon more heavenly manifestations, they looked to one who understood their origin and made the same supplication as those who were touched by the spirit in peters discourse, in king benjamins discourse, and in response to the teaching of Aaron, the brother of ammon;  what shall we do?  A direct response was given and followed resulting in conversion.  When we bring the spirit powerfully, it will also result in feelings to act, and thats when we give the invitation to make a specific action.  It is very important therefore to bring the spirit to be our heavenly manifestation.     My companion is doing well and I have to work to keep myself up with him and take part in decission making.  It is easy to just enjoy having a companion that can pull the weight just as easily if not better than you.  Its time to start putting forth my best contributions to what we do and say.  Our área is doing well and the members are liking the new techniques as we bless them.  It is really helping them to put more trust in us.  It was na interresting experience to see the power in the priesthood as we cast out the evil spirits on Friday.  Ive never seen anything like that before and I certainly will not forget it.  I am greatful to be on the side of the Lord and have the Holy Priesthood.  I love hte Gospel and have greater desires to do my all in the kindom of the Lord for the rest of my life.

Our assistente viajante (traveling assistant to the president), Elder Americo, gave us a training on how to give a blessing and invite someone to be baptized all in one visit.  I had an interview with the president during the training so I missed most of it and I’m kind of just learning with my companion and what he tells me about it.  Elder Silva and I have been trying to get the new tecniques worked out since zone conference and we are liking them. We also noticed that the things Elder Americo showed us about making an invitation to be baptized in the first visit when we give a blessing makes it easier to find people to be baptized and saves us roughly 50% of wasted time on follow up visits and teaching people who wont really get baptized.

We have other experiences to tell, but it suffices to just say that we are, really, the representatives of Jesus Christ and we hold His priesthood and I am ever happy to be His servant. This week I got a letter from the first presidency (no it wasn’t personalized to me) about elections and how if I can I should vote using the absentee ballot if at all possible.  I havnt heard practically anything about the republican party since Ive been down here, but I think that John McCain is running for president.  It seems that there is a media filter located on the borders of the US that filters anything out that has to do with the republican party.  Everyone down here seems to be in love with Obama, but if you ask why, they never know.  Its kind of funny, especially when you ask them what they know about him, of even about the republican competitor, and they just get a blank look on their face…  then you ask them what they think of abortion, gay marriage, taxes etc, and tell them “welcome to the republican party”.  I love you all and remember you in my prayer and I hope that all goes well up in the northern hemisphere.  By the way, what’s all this talk about a bail out?  Who’s in jail?  ;-)             Love Joseph

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Epistola do maravilhoso Elder AndrewsFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 22 Sep 2008 14:06:16 +0000Dear Family, This week was alright, I got to do two divisions with other areas(Imbituba and the other side of Tubarão.) and I must say that I was glad to work with my companion afterwards.  Ive noticed that a lot of missionaries have a fairly easy time developing spiritual knowledge and less ease with developing spiritual power.  Spiritual knowledge helps you get perspective, but dosnt usually help out so much in your actual work.  The power really depends on your own personal worthiness and what your relationship with the Savior amounts to.  Also, spiritual knowledge usually helps you get proud, and power is a source of and a result of humility.  Very interesting.   I got a letter from Charles a couple of weeks ago, and it was fun to see what was going on in his life.  If at all possible, I’d like to get copies of his emails and communications or whatever.  I’m glad to hear that Dad’s recovering well from his surgery.  I still have no idea what it was all about, just that he got surgery on his eye.  Usually I would say that could be rather painfull…     Here in Tubarão(which by way of interpretation is “Shark”) we are having good weather with lots of rain and consequent mud.  My shoes have begun the descent to destruction at last, though I think they’ve still got another two or three months left in them.  Ive never even had to resole them.  Most of my ties are in faded colors, but if I turn them around they seem brand new…  This morning I had a struggle over which of my shirts I would use.  Do I want to use the white one with pin stripes, or the white one with buttons in the collar?  Do I want to use the white one with no buttons in the collar, or the white ones one with button holes in the collar but has no more buttons?  Do I want to use the white one with mitered cuffs, or the white one with traditional cuffs?  Do I want to use the really white one or the kind of yellowish white one?  Boy what a day.  I think I spent a whole fifteen seconds deciding what I would wear today.  That was tough…     Well, my times already up and my companion is getting antsy.  We’re fasting and as soon as I’m done, we’ll break our fast and fill our barrigas with food.  I cant wait.  I hope you all have a wonderful week and know that I love you and pray for you.  Thank you for your prayers and support.           Love, Elder Joseph

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Dear familyFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 1 Sep 2008 21:15:16 +0000Dear family,    Sorry for not writing a letter last week.  This weeks letter is rather comprehensive, so I hope it makes up for it.  This week I got called to be a zone leader in Tubarão down south.  I’ll be 45 minutes away from my first area and can do divisions there when I want to.  President Queiroz interviewed me and asked me to help the zone apply the new techniques for teaching and get the baptisms up.  The whole zone had one baptism this last transfer.  I’m not sure why he chose me, this hasn’t been the time to be most proud of seeing as my areas not doing so well.  Oh well, I’ll just do my best.  I got to go to the leadership counsel on Friday with all the assistants and zone leaders and discuss rules, requirements etc.  We changed the way we record contacts and I think it will save the church some money and improve the effectivness of the missionaries.     We are still continuing to have good and very positive experiences with the new program and we are getting into more homes and teaching families together and not just one spouse or a few children, but their whole families.  I feel that I have a great tool in my hands that will help me have a great deal more of success on the mission.  I talked to E. Tessaro who is one of the assistants and will be going home two weeks later than most to go on divisions in the weaker zones and help integrate the new programs and asked if he was going to do a division with us in Tubarão, and he said yes.  Thats rather relieving, because I still have a few questions and Im sure he’ll give us a hand.  I’m eager to learn more and be more effective.   Agronômica is not the strongest ward I’ve ever seen, but I’m sure if we can succeed in getting more help from the members in the new program, they’ll come out of the lessons with the same response as Elder McKonkie when he saw the way that Pres. Queiroz’s father did missionary work in his mission some thirty years ago;  “POWER!!”  Something that I’ve noticed is that when we go to people’s homes to bless them, I prefer that the members have a dress shirt and tie if at all possible, so we don’t invite as many members as we used to.  It used to be that we always asked one of the young men to go along with us in and he would go with us in a t-shirt and sandals, but we want to have the appearances of a representative of Jesus Christ as we give a blessing.  If we can manage to get the help of the melchizedek priesthood quorums a little bit more, we might be able to have a little more success.  I’ve made alot of friends here, and I’m sad to go, but E. Carvalho says I’ve made a difference here, even if it dosn’t show so much in numbers.  I hope my testimony has helped those we’ve taught, be they investigator or not, to have more hope, more faith and have more desire to follow the Savior.     Yesterday we went to bless the family of an investigator that had moved and was hard to find.  Her husband was always rather against our visits as he is very catholic, so he never listened and sometimes wouldnt let us in, but we gave a blessing with his permission and after the blessing we said we had a message that could bless him and his family with the feelings of peace he was feeling right then and he accepted the offer.  He invited us to come and go in his home whenever we had a desire to visit.  WOW.  The program works.  At least two people there should be getting marked for baptism this week when we pass by again.  Then we went to another investigators home whose baptismal date had fallen and we were wanting to invite her fifteen year old son to be baptized as well, but we had already taught them the first lesson last week.  I remembered what our president  had said in the leadership counsel about the spirit being strongest during the first lesson after the first vision, and that being the time to invite to baptism, so I thought “how am I supposed to teach the first lesson again?”  So I decided to read a little from 3Ne 17 and say a prayer and then teach the restoration again with the figure aids starting at Joseph Smith.  It worked.  We marked Salete and Wilian for baptism and even got to explain to Salete why her baptism with Igreja Universal was invalid and she accepted to get baptized.  Now she just needs to start going to church.I’m thankful for the opportunity to serve as a zone leader, and throughout the past week I’ve been thinking about how I can help the other elders to have success.  I thought of why it is that the church in general can grow or cease to grow under the influence of righteous men such as prophets and apostles.  In the end, practically none of us will ever meet them, and even though we only hear from them every six months, they have an influence through their words.  They are not with us always, yet they have influence and can know how to help us.  Every time I hear E. Eyring give a talk, I feel the powerful testifying and strength of the spirit and I know what he says is there to help me and it does.  Every time.  So, the reason for this is that he lives his testimony, and his words are validated by his unseen actions.  I’ve never seen him study the scriptures, heard him pray, or make visits, yet the spirit testifies.  Everything we do makes a difference, be it waking up on time, making so many contacts, brushing your teeth and taking a shower at the designated time, companionship study, personal prayer, your attitude as a representative of Jesus Christ etc.  As Preach my Gospel says, “Your investigator’s comprehension will be directly effected by your personal worthiness.”  The Powers of the devil are great in influencing people to destruction, but the influence of the Holy Ghost and of Righteousness are greater in their power.  The Lord calls us in our weakness, but He is said to qualify us.  I’ll get to put that one to the test now.  I will go with my trust in the Lord.  I love each of you all and hope that you all have a good week.  Keep praying for me when you get a chance.  I think I’m really going to need it in my new area.  Love, Elder Andrews

Its funny that when I started serving last year in Criciúma last year, I did a division with the zone leaders here in Tubarao and I didn’t like the apartment and I thought the city was horribly ugly.  I passed the last year thinking that of all the places where I would like to serve, Tubarão would be last on my list.  Oh, the irony…  After arriving here, I find that I find the city aesthetically pleasing and the people here are gente finíssima.  I like it here.  The apartment is nicer than I seem to remember it being.  I miss serving in the country.  Its pretty and the people are a lot nicer here as well.  It reminds me of when I was serving in criciuma when I began serving my mission.  That’s good because I had a good amount of success and baptisms there.   Elder Silva is a good missionary and I enjoy teaching with him.  He speaks very good English too, and when we are in the house, we speak English.  Its been a while.  He seems very pleased with the new program and we are having a good amount of success with bringing and feeling the spirit in people’s houses.  He says that he is starting to gain a testimony of the priesthood and our power and authority.  It feels good to be with a companion who has spiritual power and to be on an equal level with each other on everything.  The area seems to be going well, and from what I’m seeing with the records with numbers, the new program’s effects are starting to kick in.  I’m sure that Elder Malheiros’ and Tessaro’s help has something to do with it.  I had a few questions about a few things and I think that it was a good experience to have their help.  Elder Silva got a few answers about the invitation to baptism answered with E Tessaro.  It was good to get to know E Tessaro a little better too.  I was always afraid of him, seeing as he always gave a serious impression.  They are helping out plenty in our zone and I think it will be good for Imbituba to have them help out for a couple of days.  The service project by Mãos que Ajudam was a success and the bishop said in sacrament meeting that the people in the neighborhood by the school we worked on see us differently now.  We already got a reference there and we will do a lot of contacting in that neighborhood on Friday.  We did the fast and saw some quick effects.  We entered someone’s house and they seemed like the kind of person that if you let them, they will talk your ears off.  So after listening to the life story of this woman, Niumfa, I asked her to imagine that Jesus Christ didn’t live two thousand years ago, but right now, and that if he were passing by her street, with a hundred people round about and healing and blessing people, he stopped in front of her house, clapped his hands and asked to bless her, what would she say?  So she said a few things about what she wanted for her family and her broken life.  As she had been talking in the beginning, I thought there was little chance that she would accept the gospel;  she just needed someone to complain to.  But then, after listening to her lament over her broken family, I felt compassion and we gave her a blessing to recover from her health problems and blessed her, her home and family.  When we finished and got up, she didn’t know what to say, just to smile and thank us.  When we bless the people, we bring the spirit and if the missionary feels charity, it is manifest.  The Lord said;  “this new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another.  By this shall men know ye are my disciples; if ye have love one to another.”  When we show the love of the savior dwelling in our hearts, they recognize the servants of the Lord, and they are more disposed to follow.     On Wednesday when I arrived in Tubarao, we went to bless someone and when E Silva said that we could bless the sick or afflicted, and asked if there was anyone sick in the house, the wife, Elielda, started to cry and raised her hand.  She was going to go have a surgery for a problem in the uterus, and asked for a blessing.  We gave a blessing that she would be cured and then we prayed for them.  I felt happy to ask the patriarch of the house if we could come back and leave a message that could bless his family for ever and even happier to hear him say yes.  We went back and taught the first lesson to the family.  As I taught the first vision, I told them that they would feel the Holy Ghost as I taught.  Elielda started to cry as we told of the appearance of the Father and the Son and I was practically crying as well.  They all accepted to be baptized.  Elder Silva was ecstatic.  I was too.  This morning we discussed things we can do to augment our teaching pool and maintain it at a large size.  I’ve been thinking on what I read about Alma sr. in Mosiah 18 and how he taught and baptized two hundred and four people while teaching “in secret”.  We are thinking of doing a second lesson with the large visual aids in the chapel every Tuesday night, because if the investigators get to know other investigators, they will not feel alone in going to church on Sundays and being baptized, but that they and their families are doing the same as other normal people.  We’ll be working on perfect the idea and the details this week.  I enjoy companionship study with E Silva.    Thank you for all you are doing and for your faith and vision which makes its way down the chain to us.  I’ll try my best to pass it on the of the missionaries.  Have a good week.&gt;        Our numbers this week are as follows;&gt;&gt; Bat/conf..............................0/0&gt; Bat marc.............................12/6&gt; Pesq na igr...........................1&gt; Liç c memb.........................15&gt; Novos..................................44&gt; Endereços............................28&gt; Lemb se disto......................96%&gt; Qualificar............................100%

I always appreciate getting emails from you and your family.  I enjoy serving as a missionary and our new program.  We offer to bless the people, then we teach them.  Peter, in the book of ST Luke, didn’t necessarily become a disciple or apostle of Jesus Christ until after the Savior had healed his mother, and the next few days later gave him financial success in his fishing.  When a blind person walked by and pleaded for the Lord to help him, He didn’t offer a message, nor money, but he cured him.  When a lame man asked Peter and John for money, Peter said that he had naught wherewith to give, but what he had he gave; wholeness.  As a result, five thousand people believed.  In 1corinthians, Paul the Apostle said that the Kingdom of God is in Power, and not in words.  We enter their homes, read Luke 10:5+9 and promise that the Holy Ghost will be present, that they will feel the peace, faith, kindness etc that is listed in Galations 5:22, and then we ask them what they would ask the Savior if he appeared.  Then we bless them and their families.  Immediately thereafter, we offer to give a message later which if they listen, will bless their families forever.  When we come back, we teach the first lesson promising that they will feel the same spirit as they did during the blessing.    The power of the priesthood is real, and I am glad to have the opportunity to exercise it.  I hope that you and your family are doing well.  Thank you for the example you set for us, I admire and look up to you and the rest of the Woodbury clan.  The church is true.  I know it and I feel it.              Love, Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: E Ai, tudo bem?From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 8 Sep 2008 18:24:51 +0000Dear Family,    This week was filled with good experiences and as I work with my new companion, Elder Silva, I appreciate having a good companion who is comfortable with the new program.  Its funny that when I started serving in Criciúma last year, I did a division with the zone leaders here in Tubarao and I didn’t like the apartment and I thought the city was horribly ugly.  I passed the last year thinking that of all the places where I would like to serve, Tubarão would be last on my list.  Oh, the irony…  After arriving here, I find that I find the city aesthetically pleasing and the people here are great.  I like it here.  The apartment is nicer than I seem to remember it being.  I miss serving in the country.  Its pretty and the people are a lot nicer here as well.  It reminds me of when I was serving in criciuma when I began serving my mission.  That’s good because I had a good amount of success and baptisms there.     Elder Silva is a good missionary and I enjoy teaching with him.  He speaks very good English too, and when we are in the house, we speak English.  It’s been a while.  He seems very pleased with the new program and we are having a good amount of success with bringing and feeling the spirit in people’s houses.  He says that he is starting to gain a testimony of the priesthood and our power and authority.  It feels good to be with a companion who has spiritual power and to be on an equal level with each other on everything.     The area seems to be going well, and from what I’m seeing with the records with numbers, the new program’s effects are starting to kick in.  I’m sure that Elder Malheiros’ and Tessaro’s help has something to do with it.  They are two missionaries who are finishing their missions together just going through our zone and helping train us on the new program.  I had a few questions about a few things and I think that it was a good experience to have their help.  Elder Silva got a few answers about the invitation to baptism answered with E Tessaro.  It was good to get to know E Tessaro a little better too.  I was always afraid of him, seeing as he always gave a serious impression.  We did a service project on Saturday painting in a public school.  The service project Mãos que Ajudam(helping hands) was a success and the bishop said in sacrament meeting that the people in the neighborhood by the school we worked on see us differently now.  We already got a reference there and we will do a lot of contacting in that neighborhood on Friday.  We did the fast and saw some quick effects.  We entered someone’s house and they seemed like the kind of person that if you let them, they will talk your ears off.  So after listening to the life story of this woman, Niumfa, I asked her to imagine that Jesus Christ didn’t live two thousand years ago, but right now, and that if he were passing by her street, with a hundred people round about and healing and blessing people, he stopped in front of her house, clapped his hands and asked to bless her, what would she say?  So she said a few things about what she wanted for her family and her broken life.  As she had been talking in the beginning, I thought there was little chance that she would accept the gospel;  she just needed someone to complain to.  But then, after listening to her lament over her broken family, I felt compassion and we gave her a blessing to recover from her health problems and blessed her, her home and family.  When we finished and got up, she didn’t know what to say, just to smile and thank us.  When we bless the people, we bring the spirit and if the missionary feels charity, it is manifest.  The Lord said;  “this new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another.  By this shall men know ye are my disciples; if ye have love one to another.”  When we show the love of the savior dwelling in our hearts, they recognize the servants of the Lord, and they are more disposed to follow.  On Wednesday when I arrived in Tubarao, we went to bless someone and when E Silva said that we could bless the sick or afflicted, and asked if there was anyone sick in the house, the wife, Elielda, started to cry and raised her hand.  She was going to go have a surgery for a problem in the uterus, and asked for a blessing.  We gave a blessing that she would be cured and then we prayed for them.  I felt happy to ask the patriarch of the house if we could come back and leave a message that could bless his family for ever and even happier to hear him say yes.  We went back and taught the first lesson to the family.  As I taught the first vision, I told them that they would feel the Holy Ghost as I taught.  Elielda started to cry as we told of the appearance of the Father and the Son and I was practically crying as well.  Elder Silva invited them to be baptized and yhey all accepted  Elder Silva was ecstatic.  I was too.  This morning we discussed things we can do to augment our teaching pool and maintain it at a large size.  I’ve been thinking on what I read about Alma sr. in Mosiah 18 and how he taught and baptized two hundred and four people while teaching “in secret”.  We are thinking of doing a second lesson(the plan of salvation) with some large visual aids emphasizing the purpose of life and the questions “where are we from?, why are we here?, and where are we going?” in the chapel every Tuesday night, because if the investigators get to know other investigators, they will not feel alone in going to church on Sundays and being baptized, but that they and their families are doing the same as other normal people.  We’ll be working on perfect the idea and the details this week.  I enjoy companionship study with E Silva.  I love you all and hope you are all doing well.  Sounds like when I get home the house will be completely different.  Crazy.  I want you all to know that I have a testimony of the fact that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is the only church with power and authority to act in the name of the Lord on the earth.  Other churches can dispute that they’ve seen visions and angels, but there are men who can speak with God face to face, and feel, physically, the prints in the hands and feet of the Savior, and they are all members of the restored church.  I’ve met one.  That is something no one can counterfeit.  We have the authority, and I take courage knowing that we’re on the winner’s side.  I love you all.                     Love, Joseph

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Elder Andrews, AgronomicaFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: presidentequeiroz@gmail.comDate: Mon, 1 Sep 2008 20:53:48 +0000Elder AndrewsElder CarvalhoAgronômicaZona FlorianópolisDear President Queiroz,   We are still continuing to have good and very positive experiences with the new program and we are getting into more homes and teaching families together and not just one spouse or a few children, but their whole families.  I feel that I have a great tool in my hands that will help me have a great deal more of success on the mission.  I talked to E. Tessaro today and asked if he was going to do a division with us in Tubarão, and he said yes.  Thats rather relieving, because I still have a few questions and Im sure he’ll give us a hand.  I’m eager to learn more and be more effective.  Elder Carvalho has grown alot since he arrived in agronômica and I’m sure he’ll be fine and work well with E. Haws.  We’ve enjoyed the last two transfers and have had a good companionship.  He has a few problems doing the new contacts and giving prayers and blessings, but he is always getting better.   Agronômica is not the strongest ward I’ve ever seen, but I’m sure if we can succeed in getting more help from the members in the new program, they’ll come out of the lessons with the same response as Elder McKonkie;  “POWER!!”  Something that I’ve noticed is that when we go to people’s homes to bless them, I prefer that the members have a dress shirt and tie if at all possible, so we don’t invite as many members as we used to.  It used to be that we always asked one of the young men to go along with us in and he would go with us in a t-shirt and sandals, but we want to have the appearances of a representative of Jesus Christ as we give a blessing.  If we can manage to get the help of the melchizedek priesthood quorums a little bit more, we might be able to have a little more success.  I’ve made alot of friends here, and I’m sad to go, but E. Carvalho says I’ve made a difference here, even if it dosn’t show so much in numbers.  I hope my testimony has helped those we’ve taught, be they investigator or not, to have more hope, more faith and have more desire to follow the Savior.  Yesterday we went to bless the family of an investigator that had moved and was hard to find.  Her husband was always rather against our visits as he is very catholic, so he never listened and sometimes wouldnt let us in, but we gave a blessing with his permission and after the blessing we said we had a message that could bless him and his family with the feelings of peace he was feeling right then and he accepted the offer.  He invited us to come and go in his home whenever we had a desire to visit.  WOW.  The program works.  At least two people there should be getting marked for baptism this week when we pass by again.  Then we went to another investigators home whose baptismal date had fallen and we were wanting to invite her fifteen year old son to be baptized as well, but we had already taught them the first lesson last week.  I remembered what you had said in the conselho de liderança, about the spirit being strongest during the first lesson after the first vision, and that being the time to invite to baptism, so I thought “how am I supposed to teach the first lesson again?”  So I decided to read a little from 3Ne 17 and say a prayer and then teach the restoration again with the figure aids starting at Joseph Smith.  It worked.  We marked Salete and Wilian for baptism and even got to explain to Salete why her baptism with Igreja Universal was invalid and she accepted to get baptized.  Now she just needs to start going to church.I’m thankful for the opportunity to serve as a zone leader, and throughout the past week I’ve been thinking about how I can help the other elders to have success.  I thought of why it is that the church in general can grow or cease to grow under the influence of righteous men such as prophets and apostles.  In the end, practically none of us will ever meet them, and even though we only hear from them every six months, they have an influence through their words.  They are not with us always, yet they have influence and can know how to help us.  Every time I hear E. Eyring give a talk, I feel the powerful testifying and strength of the spirit and I know what he says is there to help me and it does.  Every time.  So, the reason for this is that he lives his testimony, and his words are validated by his unseen actions.  I’ve never seen him study the scriptures, heard him pray, or make visits, yet the spirit testifies.  Everything we do makes a difference, be it waking up on time, making so many contacts, brushing your teeth and taking a shower at the designated time, companionship study, personal prayer, your attitude as a representative of Jesus Christ etc.  As Preach my Gospel says, “Your investigator’s comprehension will be directly effected by your personal worthiness.”  The Powers of the devil are great in influencing people to destruction, but the influence of the Holy Ghost and of Righteousness are greater in their power.     The Lord calls us in our weakness, but He is said to qualify us.  I’ll get to put that one to the test now.  I will go with my trust in the Lord.  Have a good week.

This week passed well and we have been finding new people to teach due to the new program.  I have been focusing with Elder Carvalho on the new teaching techniques and we are ever improving.           Elder Carvalho is doing well and is liking our new contacts and teaching ways and is always becoming a stronger missionary.  We get along just fine.          Our area is doing well and due to the amount of new people we are encountering, we should be marking a few more baptisms this week, especially if our investigators make it to the baptism we will be having on saturday.  We will be baptising an investigator that we encountered the first day I was here in agronomica knocking doors.  Shes cool and is prepared to be a contributing member of the church.  we also found some new people to prepare for baptism in the next two weeks or so.  We FINALLY got some new people to go to church and they liked it.  Every week we go up the hill to wake people up and go to church but this is the first week that weve come down the hill with anything to show for our efforts.  This is generally referred to as a "blessing".  This was also the highest number of investigators that  weve been able to achieve in church since I arrived.  After doing contacts the new way, it seems cheap to do it the old way.  We are eager to give up passing out cards and talking to people and offering to go to their homes to bless them.

He said that we need to focus more on blessing the people than teaching them a message.  He said that when the Lord saw a blind man in the street, He didnt say he could come by some time and teach him a message.  He cured him.  We are doing contacts differently now.  It used to be that we just stopped someone in the street and asked if we could give them a present- a pass along card- and then say a little speel about the restoration or something and tell them to call the number on the card to get the movie or book for free and a message about the restoration.  Now, we just stop people in the street and tell them that were representatives of Jesus Christ and we want to go to there house and kneel down and pray and bless them, their families and their homes and if necessary give a blessing of health to those who are sick and its free and only ten minutes.  We also have a message that if they listen, can bless their family for eternity.  Then we ask if we can come by on a specific day.  It works pretty well.  Then we teach the first lesson very quickly and immediatly after teaching about the first vision and restoration of authority, and prayer, we ask them to be baptized and if they say yes, we give them a premarked book of mormon and say, this is a proof that this is all true.  read this and pray about it and then we leave.  It works.       This week was tough, all but three appointments monday through saturday fell through and consequently we did alot of walking, knocking on doors and after getting misdirected from someone, we discovered that the Morro Horacio has an outlet up top into one of the richest neighborhoods in the city.  You have the favella and the rich next door to each other.  I switched my contacts over from giving out pass along cards to the new approach, and I must say, it was tough and nerve racking just stopping someone in the road with out offering a "present", but it paid off on sunday when we blessed the homes of the people we set up appointments with and they felt the spirit.  Elder Carvalho was somewhat nervous about doing the contacts the new way, so our contacts suffered a little bit, but this week we'll be practicing the contacts together in our companionship study, so the contacts should be picking up.  I was shocked by the amount of houses weve gotten into with the new way and the difference in how people feel the spirit.  At the end of the day on Sunday, E. Carvalho said he wanted to give Irmão Queiroz a kiss on the forehead and thank him for his help!  Ive been feeling a little discouraged in how to do the work since Ive been here in Florianopolis, but now Im feeling how I did when I first arrived on the mission;  Pumped and ready to go.  Every time I come out of a house we give a blessing in, I feel the same way I did in the beginning.           Ive thought alot over time about blessings given, and how blessings given are different depending on who gives them, especially in how much detail is given, how it is expressed etc., and I think its closely tied to the gift of prophecy and how well we are in tune with the spirit and how much charity we have.  Irmao Rodrigo is one of the people who has a gift for blessing, and we took him along with us, and my, what a spirit he brought with him.  After giving a blessing of health to one of our investigators, she asked us to bless each of her children, so we took turns blessing.  I feel priveledged to have been a holder of the melchizedek Priesthood for almost three years before going on a mission and discovering the marvelous opportunity to give blessings, and speak on behalf of our Lord.  I love to bless people, and I am happy to be doing it more plainly now.  Last night we went to an investigators house who always listens alone while his wife and daughter go to another room.  Weve invited her several times to listen and you can tell that Evertom, our investigator, wants her to take part too, but she never comes, so we planned to just bless their family, their house and their lives and leave, so that she could feel the spirit and start taking part.  If she does start participating, they will both most certainly be baptized.  I read 3Ne 17, and then we prayed for them.  The results are beyond expression.  What member would want to miss something like this?  to go to peoples homes, to bless them, to feel the power of the priesthood in action, to see what the apostles saw?  Its all true, and my testimony increases and my love for Agronômica grows despite my seemingly fruitless work here.  One of our investigators weve been teaching and had a problem with smoking stopped smoking and I asked her if she had any objections to being baptized this saturday.  She was already marked for some time in august, but it was just kind of a hollow goal, so I asked her more seriously.  She asked if we thought she was ready, so I told her absolutly.  She had only just finished telling her about how she didnt have any doubts, so The answer has to be yes.  Shes excited.           I love you family and I pray for you all.  have a good week and remember that I love you all.                      Love, Elder Andrews

Here in Floripa there is an interresting phenomenon;  You have the insanely rich and the poor of the world as next door neighbors.  As many have observed in the past,the rich are generally set on the things of this world(this being a general statement, and not implying to people individually;  I know many rich people who are the salt of the earth) It is easiest to work with success in the poorer areas, where the people in general are more meek and genuine, hence we find ourselves working ing the favella and helping people improve their lives, but when the majority of the active membership of the ward is composed of the rich, they have a fear of entering into the ghetto to help us teach or, if the said member is a returned missionary, his wife dosnt like him to go there, even if he is accustomed to it, or loves to relive his own mission memories and help the poor in spirit come unto Christ.  My companion calls the Island ''A ilha das amazonas'' (the island of the amazon women).  All the men are a little controlled by their wives.  The class division is rather hindering to our number of lessons with member present.  This last week we asked a family if we could bring an investigator from the Morro Horacio (the ghetto) to an FHE, but the wifes response was negative enough that I got really depressed for the differences in classes among the people and our ward in particular.  I was very very gratefull for having achieved the standard of excellence in lessons with members present this week, but we had to sacrifice some appointments in other neighborhoods to stick around in an area where a priest helps us out.  We still found people to teach and marked a few baptisms that we were not expecting to continue teaching and the week ended on a spiritual high, so Im not necessarily complaining.         Elder Carvalho is always improving and I have been quite impressed with his progress in teaching and focus.  If he continues to improve in this manner, he will certainly be a fine missionary.  We have a good relationship and I am enjoying working with him.  I always like my third and fourth transfers in an area, because I get to know the investigators better and I can see our progress.         I love you all and hope that you have a great week.          Love Joseph

Here in Floripa there is an interresting phenomenon;  You have the insanely rich and the poor of the world as next door neighbors.  As many have observed in the past,the rich are generally set on the things of this world(this being a general statement, and not implying to people individually;  I know many rich people who are the salt of the earth) It is easiest to work with success in the poorer areas, where the people in general are more meek and genuine, hence we find ourselves working ing the favella and helping people improve their lives, but when the majority of the active membership of the ward is composed of the rich, they have a fear of entering into the ghetto to help us teach or, if the said member is a returned missionary, his wife dosnt like him to go there, even if he is accustomed to it, or loves to relive his own mission memories and help the poor in spirit come unto Christ.  My companion calls the Island ''A ilha das amazonas''.  The class division is rather hindering to our number of lessons with member present.  This last week we asked a family if we could bring an investigator from the Morro Horacio (the ghetto) to an FHE, but the wifes response was negative enough that I got really depressed for the differences in classes among the people and our ward in particular.  I was very very gratefull for having achieved the standard of excellence in lessons with members present this week, but we had to sacrifice some appointments in other neighborhoods to stick around in an area where a priest helps us out.  We still found people to teach and marked a few baptisms that we were not expecting to continue teaching and the week ended on a spiritual high, so Im not necessarily complaining.         Elder Carvalho is always improving and I have been quite impressed with his progress in teaching and focus.  If he continues to improve in this manner, he will certainly be a fine missionary.  We have a good relationship and I am enjoying working with him.  I always like my third and fourth transfers in an area, because I get to know the investigators better and I can see our progress.         Our numbers this week are as follows;bapt/conf................................0/0bat marc.................................8/4pesq na igr...............................1liç c memb................................15novos......................................15contatos...................................144lemb s dis.................................95%qual p esp.................................100%Have a great week.

If we could have had one more day I wouldnt compain.  Sometimes it seems that nothing happens until the weekend with our numbers with member present, but we always seem to pull through.  Alot of things didnt work out despite our best efforts, such as people in church and lessons with member present ect, but the week finished on a high note for me.  It was sunday night, and we needed two more new investigators, and two more lessons with a member present, so I thought it would be a good idea to pass by a members house whose sister in law was staying with them and sing a hymn and leave a message extremely fast, so we went there last of all.  We got there and I sang O Pai Celeste (Father in Heaven).  The sister in law didnt really pay much attention, but when I finished singing, I noticed that the irmão was crying.  He asked us to give him a blessing, so we gave.  He was getting ready for a job interview and was feeling sick and probably had a few other concerns too.  I have always loved to give blessings.  He said that it was perfect that we came and that he was needing it.  This brother was in need of spiritual help, and we were able to give it.  Another member that was there with him offered to go out to do visits with us any morning that we needed and it served to build a stronger relationship with some of the members here in Agronomica.  To think about it, if we hadnt been so pushed for numbers, we wouldnt have gone or even thought of going there.  When you have faith and do your best, even the bad situations can strengthen you and edify your testimony.  I can assure you that this dosnt mean we'll be slacking off to get more experiences like that again.  We'll get our numbers right this week and trabalhar até o pó.         Elder Carvalho is doing well and is learning english little by litte.  Its kind of fun to discover how english grammar works and teach it to someone.  Every one thinks english is easy because the verbs are all conjugated the same way in relation to I speak, you speak, we speak, they speak, you(all) speak, he/she/it speaks. etc, but there is no pattern for how to say things in past tense, other than putting an "ed" on the end, but its not always that easy.  Elder Carvalho now hates the words irregular verb.  He is teaching well, but I want to help him teach a little more from the heart and less what he knows is in a given principle of the lessons.        Our area is doing well, we have about five or six people that are progressing well and show a strong possibility of being baptized when we can get them going to church regularly and married along with a few other complications.  We went to go get our investigators and bring them to church two times on sunday, but no one came.  That hurt a little, but next week should be better.  Someone dropped by during church to ask us to visit her and inviter her to go to church, so we'll be contacting her this week.  We also have plans to get the members visiting and helping out with our investigators, though it may still be dificult to get someone to go up to the Morro Horacio with us.  The farther you go up the hill, the uglier it gets, and fortunately, we arent working too far up the hill.          This week I was riding the bus, thinking of how I should do better with doing contacts, when I decided "Im already on a mission, Im on a bus filled with a bunch of bored people, why not make use of time?"  So I did contacts on the bus and also in the bus station.  I dont know exactly why, but doing contacts always makes me feel better about myself even though I have such a timid nature about doing contacts.  If I ever feel depressed, I should do contacts.         Our numbers this week are as follows;Bat/conf....................................0/0Bat marcado...............................8/4pesq na igr.................................0Liç c memb................................14novos.......................................14contatos....................................142Lemb s dis..................................90%Qualificar p esp............................100%

I’ve been studying the healing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, as stated in Alma 7, and Matthew 11:28-30.  I read also the talk given by Elder Scott in the april 2008 general conference about overcoming the negative results of abuse(or having a loved one killed by the hands of your enemies).  As I read, I really felt the truth of the power of the atonement.  I also read the references he gave to other talks in the end of his talk.  What Dallin H Oaks said in his talk ‘He heals the heavy laden’ was especially helpful and I slowly began to remember the comfort I have received in my own trying experiences. Elder Carvalho is doing well, though to tell the truth, I am somewhat concerned about his effectiveness as a missionary especially for when he becomes senior.  He does fine right now, but when he is on his own, he could have a hard time working. He has a hard time focusing on what were doing, but I’m going to try to include him a little more in decision making and teach him how to work his tail off.  It might be good for me too.  He’s a good missionary and I hope to help him in any way possible.  I think praying out loud for your companion and his family helps him out a lot and makes your companionship stronger.  It’s a habit I plan to carry with me into my family and pray for every person and their needs and concerns in family prayer and in the future, prayer with my spouse.One of our investigators´ sons was killed last week and when we showed up a day later I had no idea for what to say, so we gave a few thoughts and afterward a blessing.  When we returned a couple of days later, she was doing better and we retaught the plan of salvation really fast and tried to see if there was anything we could do to help her.  I feel that one of the reasons I was sent here in agronomica was to help her as she goes through this experience and help her to understand the power of the atonement to heal us and give us that profound peace that comes despite our indescribable pain.  I felt that a few years ago in regard to my Mothers death, and I feel that I can help our investigator, Salete, feel the same through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Ever since we started teaching her two months ago, I felt impressed to focus on the doctrines in Alma chapter 7 in regards to how the Savior suffered all our pains so that He could know how to succor us in our need.   I met up with the last person on earth that I would be expecting to meet when doing contacts on Monday night;  the bishop of Itajai.  Boy was it good to see a familiar face.  I was glad to hear about our baptisms that are still active and how the ward there is still growing.  I know they are being blessed for their assistance to the missionary work there, be it in the past or present.

You can keep a copy if you like and if you think it appropriate you can give it to Brother Sherwood.Jesus Christ was chosen before this earth was created to be our savior and redeemer. He is the god of the old testament and the great I AM; Jehovah. All things exist by the grace of His glory. He is the Light and the Life of the world, a light that is endless, that never can be darkened, a light that gives life to all creatures in existance. He took upon Himself flesh and blood and walked among us, even the light which ilumines our lives, yet he was rejected, for men loved darkness and reject the light. He walked among us and grew grace for every grace, light upon light until He recieved a fulness of the Glory of the Father, and was and is One with the Father. He was pure, clean from all sin, and was worthy to fulfill His mission and bring to pass the eternal life and imortality of mankind by means of making atonement with His bretheren, and our very Eternal Father.It was He who created the earth and filled it with light. He was chosen from the beginning to overcome the natural effects of the fall and allow us, His bretheren, to be redeemed from physical death through resurrection and spiritual death on conditions of following His Gospel of Faith on His name, Repentance, Baptism, Baptism by the reciept of the gift of the Holy Ghost and abiding in accordance with all other ordinances of His Gospel. He is the God of the Old Testament, the Hope of Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel.He was born to Mary, a virgin, and is the very Son of God in the flesh. He was born of humble circumstances and gave the perfect example of service and righteousness, walking before His Father with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind, yet He never ceded to sin. Being thus pure He qualified Himself to make Himself an offering for sin. In the Garden of Gethsemane, He suffered for our sins, making possible a remission of our sins. He took upon Him the pains and hurt of all men that have ever lived and have yet to live, that He might know how to succor them in their need, and bind up the broken hearted. These things I know, for I myself have felt His power to purify of sin, His matchless peace that comes to those who suffer, and I testify that this power is very, very real. After suffering in Gethsemane, He was imprisoned, judged unlawfully and delivered up to be given an ignominious and horrible death. Crucifiction, the death consigned to thieves and assasins was decreed on the only human being to walk blamelessly on this earth, even the creator of this world, and there, on Calvary, he poured out His whole soul unto death. His great heart litteraly broke for sorrow of the sins of His people. ‘Behold the wounds in His hands His feet, the Blood and tears both mingled down. Did e’re such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown?’After three days in the sepulchre, Jesus Christ, the Annointed One ressurrected to life and immortality. I testify, with the energy of my living soul, that He does, indeed, live. And by so living, all men shall live again, raised from corruption to incorruption, from death to endless life, then to be judged by the very being that suffered their cause. As a ressurrected being, He still lives, He still loves and He still speaks. After the long darkness of apostasy and absence of His holy Priesthood and men called after His holy order, He and our Eternal Father appeared to Joseph Smith and called him to be an Elias or restorer of the fulness of the Gospel. Jesus Christ has spoken again and sent forth angels to teach men the Plan of Salvation and ordain men to His Holy Order to teach these things to the rest of the children of men. I have been called to this Order, and having recieved an holy calling and ordinance, I testify, in the very name of Jesus Christ, that Jesus Christ lives. All men can grow in His holy light through repentance and holy works, and see that light grow brighter and brighter until the perfect day. As I ponder His amazing sacrifice, I am want to sing the words; ‘Love so amazing, so divine demands my heart, my life, my all.’  That all that read may find the grace of this Jesus and reach His peace and salvation is my prayer, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ.                                    AMENJoseph Levi Andrews

We are getting better at contacting references and finding new people.  We  have also been blessed with people who are attending church regularly.  This week I decided to read Acts in portuguese.  The Bible hás always been hard for me to understand in portuguese, but to my surprise, I’m getting better.  As I passed through chapters fifteen to the end, I was impressed with how much Paul loved the people of the cities where he passed and even had a farewell to bear testimony one last time to his friends and the leaders of the church in their respective places.  He knew that he wouldn’t see them again in mortality and that there would be apostasy soon after his leaving, so he bore his testimony and prayed for them.  It never occurred to me how much Paul loved the people he met in his missions. Elder Carvalho and I discussed the progress of our area this morning and decided to make some goals for the area and how we will improve our work as well.  Our ward seems very stagnate.  There are no youth, the majority of the ward is composed of students or young couples and almost all the men are already high priests.  Yet the people here seem to do nothing but go to church, and consequently they are prone to weakening testimony.  We’ve decided to help them out and pass by peoples houses that dont know us and leave messages and invitations for service.  One of the members here hás started to help us out alot as a result of our visiting him a few times.  He is a member of the bishopric and seems a very strong member, but he says that he was feeling weak and spiritually stagnate, and even talked to the bishop about it.  But after our passing by a coulple of times and after going with us to teach, he feels remarkably better.  In the quiet heart is hidden sorrow that the eye cant see.  If the members start helping out, the spirituality of the ward will grow, according to what President Benson says in the end of PMG chapter 1.  We want to start helping out the members and then they should start going with us to teach.Elder Carvalho is doing well and I am seeing a difference in his attitude as he thinks more about the work and less about other things that dont matter.  He is progressing well.This week our numbers were less than pleasing, seeing that an entire family that was marked  for baptism moved away and we put off our contacts until when there was no time left to do them.  We will do much better this week.  Our numbers this week are as follows;Bapt/conf..................................0/0Bapt marc.................................7/3Pesq na igr................................4Liç c membro...........................15Novos pesq...............................15Contatos....................................88Lemb s dis.................................90%Qualificar p espírito..................100%Have a good week.

This week was a good week for me, even though it isnt particularly shown in our numbers.  My testimony of the divine help we recieve as missionaries was strengthened through this weeks experiences.        Elder Carvalho is doing well.  After conference on Wed. I noticed a marked difference in the way he teaches and focuses in the missionary work.  Before, he seemed to have alot of lightheartedness, and at times lightindedness, and didnt really think about what it was that we were doing, but now he seems to focus on and think about our investigators and how he can help them.  He teaches differently and has begun to give up saying the same things over and over, and to just bear testimony about what he says, pricipally because he studies those things, and they therefore are treasured up in his heart.  I dont know what you said to him, but I think it made a great difference.  He is an excellent missionary, and his good traits are coming out and his potential is being realized.        After zone conference, alot of time was wasted in getting back to our areas due to the strike, and we got home at eight o clock, which left us only one hour to work and all our appointments, which were all late of course as we had planned to be back and working at 16:00.  So it was impossibe to get to any of our marked appointments in Saco Grande due to the strike-its a two hour walk to the other side of the bay where our appointments were- we were going to have to work in our own neighborhood and we dont have any investigators here in Trindade, so I was pretty much at loss for what to do.  So I prayed.  I asked for us to be able to find someone that was needing our message and that we could be led to.  I felt like we should go to a neighborhood on the other side of Morro da Cruz, (Serrinha) so we started walking there and after fifteen minutes, I stopped, because there was still another fifteen minutes to walk and by the time we got there we would have only ten minutes to teach and then another half an hour walk to get home again.  So I said another prayer and decided to go up the street to our right, and it seemed familiar, so I kept going, felt like we should go left, then left again, and found a house of an investigator whose daughter is a member and had asked us not to come by any more when I first got here in May, due to problems with her husband, and consequently after serving with my last companion who showed me the area for only one transfer, I had no idea where it was that she lived.  So I explained the situation to my companion and asked him if we should knock.  He said it was up to me, but he didtnt think it was a particularly great idea, so we walked to the street corner and stopped to talk about what to do from there, but I really didnt know if we ought to not pass by that house, so we passed in front again, but kept going, and stopped at the other street corner, and decided to pass by one more time, and again.  At last I decided that if the Lord guided us there in the first place, even if that wasnt the intended destination in my mind, we should knock.  So we knocked.  Her husband wasnt there, so she came out and we sang a hymn for her and asked if we could start passing by again, and she said yes.  She said she would also come to church on sunday with her daughter and we marked an FHE in the bishops house on monday.  She said she was  needing the visit and it was meant for us to come that night.  I left feeling happy and gratefull that the Lord guides His servants and that our day was not wasted.  The Lord lives, and as I tell many of the people we teach, because He lives, He has a mouth, and therefore still speaks.  I am greatful to have the truth and to have the influence of the Holy Ghost to give me peace, guidance and knowledge that I need.         We also had four investigators in church, which is the best we have yet achieved here.  When I was in itajai, we managed to get ninteen people in church several times, and after doubling and tripling numbers, we felt sanctified and that our sacrifice was accepted, and here in Florianoplolis, after wearing out our whole souls, we get only four people in church and just barely get our minium standards, yet I feel the same thing as in Itajai.  Some places are harder, but the Lord sees your efforts and blesses you.         Our numbers this week are as follows;Bat/Conf..................0/0Bat marcado..............14/4Pesq na Igreja............4Liç c membro.............12Novos Pesqisadores......17Contatos...................144Lembe-se disto............95%Qualificar p Esp............100%Thank you for all you are doing for us.  We appreciate it and your enthusiasm for helping us succeed.  May the Lord bless you and Sister Queiroz for your sacrifices.  Have a good week.           Love, Elder Andrews

This week as I was preparing training for district meeting (needless to say it was the night before the meeting) I was studying about people who had great successes in their work in the scriptures, for example, Aaron, the son of Mosiah helped in convert thousands of lamanites, including their king, Peter converted and baptized three thousand persons, and king Benjamin succeeded in converting an entire people.  Result of my study;  The three of them used the process of teaching and prophesying (bearing pure testimony), and inviting to action with the promise of specific blessings.  This is of course already stated as a process in the manual Preach My Gospel, but what I discovered is this;  when people feel the absolute yearning for that connection with the unknown deity, for the knowledge of the almighty, when they feel that they are striking on the keys of something familiar that is true, and when they feel the altogether indescribable prick of the spirit in their hearts, they desire to do something.  That only comes after you teach by the power of the spirit, and that power of speech usually follows your train of thought based on what you have studied and is the current focus of your thoughts in regard to things spiritual.  When people feel that you can see it in their eyes and sometimes even ask what it is that they can do.  We can tell them what they can do to achieve that unknown desire and even discover what it is that they are desiring unknowingly.  Its fun to learn things by the spirit.   I’m still alive and doing well and our area is improving slowly but surely as people are FINALLY starting to come to church regularly.     I hope you all have a good week and remember that I love you and pray for you.  You’re all the best.            Love, Elder Andrews

Quite frankly I think its working, but now we just need to get a little more help from the members in teaching.        My companion, Elder Carvalho, and I are becoming good friends and our companionship grows well.  We are still getting used to teaching together (he arrived in the area a week and a half ago) and I am gratefull to have a companion who teaches with the spirit.  He is very talkative, so there is never a dull moment.  He is a good missionary.         This week we taught someone we made a contact with several weeks ago, to whom we gave a pass along card "Finding Faith in Christ", and upon recieving it he asked how he could do what we do etc. and so we took down his adress and number, planning to visit him.  Apparently he requested the DVD, but gave an old adress, because yesterday when we were still teaching him and had just  finished marking him for baptism, the zone leaders called him to find out when they could deliver the DVD.  Pretty interresting coincidence.  He is pretty much the perfect investigator.  We have a number of other investigators that are progressing well, though it will probably be another month before we baptize anyone, mostly because no one goes to church, even if we go to pick them up.  We'll make it one of these days.        I got Grandma Zahllers note, and it is good to hear that she is doing well.  Last week on Pday I got to go to a music studio and play a cello.  Its been a while, but for playing for over a year, Im still alright.  Happy Birthday to Chrayles.  I hope you all are doing well and I pray for you.  Have a great week.            Love Elder Andrews

Esta vai ser a primeira vez que escrevo em português então desculpe os erros.  Nesta semana eu tenho pensado muito sobre o que eu posso fazer para melhorar em nossos números e crescer o nosso grupo de ensino.  Nossos números com lições com membro presente nunca parecem bem, e de fato sempre são baixos, então pensei no que posso fazer para melhorar.  Parece que se eu tiver um bom planejamento semanal no dia fixo,(sexta-feira) eu vou poder convidar membros um bom tempo antes.  Foi interessante algo que um membro explicou no quorum dos elderes no domingo sobre planejar e preparar antes para pular um obstáculo;  se você ver um obstáculo como um “hurdle” em seu caminho, vai ter que preparar soltar, crescendo em velocidade, porque ao pular mais que 0.25 metros, é necessário que tenha velocidade –que é speed e direção combinado-.  Se esperar pular e preparar até chegar perto do obstáculo, não conseguirá passar sem voltar e adquirir a velocidade exigida.  Que pena a volta.  Acho que vou aplicar isso mais em minha missão, começando com melhor planejamento.  Preparação para reunião de distrito foi muito interessante.  Pensei no que você disse na entrevista sobre como Pedro conseguiu batizar três mil pessoas.  Ao olhar no capítulo 11 de Pregar Meu Evangelho, percebi um padrão no que Pedro, o filho de Mosias Arão, e Rei Benjamin fizeram com prestar testemunho puro, o princípio do que quando pessoas sentiram aquele sede que vem do toque do Espírito Santo, querem, desejam, de todo coração fazer algo.  Nós, como os representantes de Cristo, temos a responsibilidade convidar as pessoas fazer esse “algo”, qual seja, ser batizado, se arrepender, ir à igreja etc., e no processo, prometer as bênçãos da ação dita.  Gosto de ser ensinado pelo espírito.  Se sente muito bem. Elder Carvalho está bem.  Ele tem dificuldades acordar e se levantar de manhã mas está melhorando.  Nós estamos bem com amizade e somos amigos.    Nossa área vai bem.  Sempre é uma luta levar pesquisadores para igreja, mas em fim estamos conseguindo com dois pesquisadores.  Mais um vai começar nesta semana.  Uma metade de nossos pesquisadores com data marcada estão se mudando para outros lugares esta mês, então, este numero vai cair um pouco, mas estamos sendo abençoados com novos pessoas e referencias também.  Os membros estão nos dando referencias agora e o futuro está sorrindo brilhantemente diante nós.  Obrigado por tudo que faz, e esperamos que tudo vai bem com vocês.  Favor, agradeça á Sister Queiroz pelo bolo hoje.  Nossos números são a seguinte;Batismos/Conf.................................0/0Batismos marcados.........................11/4Pesquisadores na igr........................3Lições c membro.............................11Novos Pesquisadores.......................16Contatos...........................................140Lembre-se Disto................................90%Qualificar pelo Espírito.....................100%Boa semana,                c/  amor,      Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Elder Andrews sends you greetingsFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 7 Jul 2008 13:30:20 +0000Dear family,       Im glad you all had a good week, I really enjoyed your letter.  Its fun to hear how Morgan is working with Dad.  Working with Dad was an interresting experience for me, and looking back, I think I could have been a little more proactive when I was working.  I should have asked questions and know what was going on rather than just wait to be told what to do.  But I learned to work.  I got to work in several different environments and what I discovered is that it is fun to put your heart into what you do and feel good about it afterward.  Boy does that sound like an old irish proverb...        We have a member here that we call HomemAranha(SpiderMan), because two weeks ago we were building a house (which by the way is ridiculously more simple than building a house in Lenexa) and he was up in the rafters putting up the roof when he fell from four meters, and broke through the floor.  We call him spiderman because he got up with out a scratch somehow.  He fell some four feet away from me, so when I looked down, I thought he must have died, but to our surprise and relief, he lives on, unbruised.         You shouldnt tell me about what kind of cake you made for Charles birthday, just thinking about it made me drool with homesickness...  Just kidding.  They have some pretty good kinds of food down here, especially when they make stroganov and rice.  Rice and beans grows on you too.  If you go for a day without it, you actually start to crave it.  There are ALOT of italians in the south of Brazil, so there is alot of italian food, and a decent amount of german pastries due to the high german population too.  They dont have peanut butter or maple syrup, and avocados are for making sweets, not guacamole.  But the food is good.        Thats sad that someone in the ward is not in a good situation, especially if I know them.  I hope the situation turns out for the best.  Its good to hear international finance and politics and stuff.  Its interresting.        This week we had zone conference and interviews with our new mission president.  Hes cool and we all like him.  Hes young too; 48 or something.  The bus system was on strike that day, so we rented a van to take us all back to our reaspective areas on the Island, and it was during rush hour, so we all talked and convered and everything for a long time.  It was fun but it also makes you a little homesick for social life, but we survive.  We got home at eight o clock, which left us only one hour to work and all our appointments, which were late of course, were impossibe to get to due to the strike-its a two hour walk to the other side of the bay where our appointments were- we were going to have to work in our own neighborhood and  we dont have any investigators here, so I was pretty much at loss for what to do.

So I said another prayer and decided to go up the street to our right, and it seemed familiar, so I kept going, felt like we should go left, then left again, and found a house of an investigator whose daughter is a member and had asked us not to come by any more when I first got here in May, due to problems with her husband, so I explained the situation to my companion and asked him if we should knock.

Elder Carvalho is very talkative and keeps life lively.  When a companion leaves we notice just how much we depended on them, especially when they have more experience in the area.  The Lord helps us though.  I am going to have to start asking for more adresses from contacts in order to keep busy.  The afternoon goes by slow alot of the times.       Elder Carvalho is a good missionary and I am trying to help him be a little more independant on how to teach.  I think he thinks that the senionr companion does everything.  Through better planning I think well succeed in getting more united in out teaching efforts.  He talks alot, so theres never a dull moment.        Getting people to church is still hard as ever.  One of our investiagators made it to church, but didnt stay for sacrament meeting.  Of the eight we made arrangements for to be in church, none came, but a member brought a refferal to church, so we didnt get zero.  I am very grateful for that.  We now have several investigators that look somewhat possible to be baptize so were happy.        From time to time I get down about our numbers, especially after our successes in Itajai.  At times I wonder what I could do better, and there is always an answer, but I still feel good as I serve people and help them gain hope in and through the atonement of Christ.  Our ward looks perfect when you go to church, but in the quiet heart is hidden sorrow that the eye cant see.  Things are improving and I have a hope that they will continue to improve.      Thank you for all you have done for us, it is much appreciated, and I hope that you finish well.  The fruits of your labors do not end with your last few weeks' numbers, nor your last week or the weeks that follow.  The seeds youve sown will continue to bear fruit long after the tree is gone.  Thank you for the impact and service youve given us, our investigators and to the Lord.

I dont think I have ever seen the creek get up over the bridge on 151st before.  It seems that Charles'  new bike is pretty fancy.  Perhaps a little better than the one he used on his mission.  I met a guy from paraguay last night.  If all goes well, we should be teaching him in the next few weeks.  Elder Eliakim didnt believe me when I told him how you say I go and I fall in Guarani, so I asked the guy how you say it.  ''Ha ha, aha ha-ah ha'' or something like that.          This morning we went to the mission home to play soccer, Florianopolis zone against Sao Jose zone.  We won of course.  My companion can play against three people and always score a goal.  I played goalie and did well enough that they wanted me to stay there for another three hours.  I had fun and got kicked a few times when I jumped on the ball, but it was fun.  I like being in Florianopolis, because on p day we can see people from the other areas close by, especially old companions and friends from the MTC.         Elder Eliakim is still being as great a missionary as he ever was, so that makes it so I have nothing to worry about there.  I think he is ready to be a senior companion as well.  He is a great missionary.  From time to time he gets a little down about people not recieving us any more, or people not keeping commitments, but I think if he has a happy companion he should always be fine.  We get along great.          Our area is on the verge of a breakout in missionary work.  The members are telling us about a number of people they are preparing to recieve the lessons from us.  The members are excited to give us lunches, so thats a blessing to us as well.  I think it helps out a great deal to be in such frequent contact with the missionaries.  It helps with referrals.  Its really hard to get people to go to church.  This week Im going to ask for help from several members to pick up investigators.  I find that when members go with us to teach, it does more than prepare for better retention, it also helps with people getting to church.  We have a number of investigators that are getting more and more ready for baptism, they just need to get started going to church.       I love you all and hope you all have a good summer.  Im enjoying the fall and winter down here.  Heat is not pleasant with leather shoes long pants and a tie.  I prefer the cold.  Have a good week.              Love Elder Andrews

It seems like people suck up information like active charcoal but applying it is something that takes enormous effort.  We started to use what President Cardon from the CTM calls Faith of Power to achieve the goal of baptizing someone that seems not to want to be baptized and sees no need for it while every relative he has is baptized or is getting baptized.  So we put together some goals for us and a few other things and asked the Lord for help.  Result; Wanderley -our investigator-went to church even though there was a soccer game to watch and his wife (who is a less active member) was sick.  I think there is a connection there.  Something I want to apply more is a system of goal making based off of the baptismal questions involving what we need to do, what the Lord needs to do and what the investiagators need to do in order to achieve conversion.  It just takes alot of time to set up and alot of paper, but it should give us a little of balast to get our teaching organized better for the benefit of the investigator.       Elder Eliakim will be transferred this week and E. Carvalho will take his place.  E. Carvalho is also brazilian so I can still practice my portuguese.  I have greatly enjoyed being companions with E. Eliakim.  He is a good missionary.  Everyone here in the agronomica ward will miss him including me.  I am always a little bit nervous with showing an area to another companion, but I am sure I will survive.        Our area is going well, we have alot more investigators and one of them, Everton, came to church on his own (this being a miracle) with his whole family.  Everton seemed to be along the lines of a philosophy major when we met him more than a month ago, but has slowly been changing, recieving a softer heart.  He lost one of his children a few years ago a week after being born and lost faith in God.  Before that, he had been courageous in standing up for God, but lost faith in losing a child.  At times, I feel a strong impression that I really am sent to teach these specific people, so that my personal experiences can bless their lives as I relate what has happened in my own life.  As I began my mission, I kept my own mothers death as a secret, afraid of making others uncomfortable, but the experiences that I passed through following her passing are of great value in helping others forgive and accept the will of the Lord.  When my own mother died, I knew there was a reason and something that I was supposed to learn from the experience, but I had to wait for three years to get an answer, and if it had not happened, I could not have gained my testimony of the Living Christ, nor His indescribable capacity to bind up the broken hearted, and thus be empowered to bear greater testimony of Him as I serve a mission.  Everton came to church.        Paraguay beat Brazil in soccer yesterday.  Que vergonha.  I hope you all have a good week and remember that I love you all.           Boa semanaElder Andrews

It seems like people suck up information but applying is something that takes enormous effort.  We started to use what President Cardon from the CTM calls Faith of Power to achieve the goal of baptizing someone that seems not to want to be baptized and sees no need for it while every relative he has is baptized or is getting baptized.  So we put together some goals for us and a few other things and asked the Lord for help.

With the dedication and celebration in Curitiba it was a little difficult to get lessons with members present, but we managed to get by.  I enjoyed the celebration and dedication, they were both spiritual experiences.         Elder Eliakim is a good missionary.  From time to time I think he loses hope of success with baptism and retention.  When you transfer him, I think it might be good for him to go to a place where he can baptize, but thats entirely up to you.  Im trying to help him have good experiences, and hope to get some good progressing investigators for him and for me.  I think Im going to have to do some more fasting and praying to find the elect here in agronomica.  Sometimes it seems that everybody smokes or is unmarried.  I always need to improve myself so that when I teach the spirit can be carried to the hearts of the people in such a way as to give them a desire to change.  That requires more than teaching lessons;  I need to incorporate more of testimony, because when I use my testimony in its pure form, the gifts of the spirit, be it of tongues, prophecy and promising blessings etc. will abound and help me more.  I am trying reteaching multiple times the first three lessons to people.  well see how it works.       Thank you for your help to us and your support and letting me come to see you on friday.  I hope you have a good week and travel safely.  Well see you on wednesday.

There was a temple dedication and celebration on saturday and sunday, so almost all the members were up north in Curitiba for the week end, which is prime teaching time, so we suffered a little this week with lessons with members present, but this week should be alot better.  Sacrament was immediately after the temple dedication broadcasted in downtown Florianopolis, so we didnt get any investigators to watch it with us.  There was an american there who was on business selling surveillance systems who dosnt speak portuguese, so I offered to translate for him.  Translating is portuguese to english is hard.  Luckilly most of the presentation was translated from english to portuguese, so I survived the dedication, but testimony meeting was a little different.        We ate lunch with one of the members yesterday who is a professional cook and maid, so she really knows how to make good food.  She made a carrot cake for me since it was my birthday, so it was a good day.  Sounds like the young men had a good time on the high adventure.  Im glad they did something different this year.  This week in zone conference a sister and I will sing I believe in Christ, so weve been trying to put something special together, I wanted to do a key change on the last verse, but it didnt work out unless we went up a halfstep to e flat major.  It sounds good, but singing tenor gets hard when you hit the peak of your singing range.  I think itll turn out well though.        People in Florianopolis are a little harder to teach, so Im having a hard time deciding whether to keep with some of our investigators that arent progressing or not.  Its a hard decision to make sometimes.  It was good to hear the prophet yesterday.  Im glad we have a prophet who can speak to the Lord on our behalf and I am glad to have a testimony.  I hope you all have a good week and pray for you.           Love Elder Andrews

He asked us to write our testimony of Jesus Christ for him.  I figured it dosnt hurt to send it to family either, so Ill share it with you.  I think it is appropriate that you hear/read the testimony of your posterity and know that your efforts have an effect in my life.  Thank you for all you have done to help me in adqiring a personal testimony.  I love you and pray for you too.         Jesus Christ was chosen before this earth was created to be our savior and redeemer. He is the god of the old testament and the great I AM; Jehovah. All things exist by the grace of His glory. He is the Light and the Life of the world, a light that is endless, that never can be darkened, a light that gives life to all creatures in existance. He took upon Himself flesh and blood and walked among us, even the light which ilumines our lives, yet he was rejected, for men loved darkness and reject the light. He walked among us and grew grace for every grace, light upon light until He recieved a fulness of the Glory of the Father, and was and is One with the Father. He was pure, clean from all sin, and was worthy to fulfill His mission and bring to pass the eternal life and imortality of mankind by means of making atonement with His bretheren, and our very Eternal Father.It was He who created the earth and filled it with light. He was chosen from the beginning to overcome the natural effects of the fall and allow us, His bretheren, to be redeemed from physical death through resurrection and spiritual death on conditions of following His Gospel of Faith on His name, Repentance, Baptism, Baptism by the reciept of the gift of the Holy Ghost and abiding in accordance with all other ordinances of His Gospel. He is the God of the Old Testament, the Hope of Israel, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel.He was born to Mary, a virgin, and is the very Son of God in the flesh. He was born of humble circumstances and gave the perfect example of service and righteousness, walking before His Father with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind, yet He never ceded to sin. Being thus pure He qualified Himself to make Himself an offering for sin. In the Garden of Gethsemane, He suffered for our sins, making possible a remission of our sins. He took upon Him the pains and hurt of all men that have ever lived and have yet to live, that He might know how to succor them in their need, and bind up the broken hearted. These things I know, for I myself have felt His power to purify of sin, His matchless peace that comes to those who suffer, and I testify that this power is very, very real. After suffering in Gethsemane, He was imprisoned, judged unlawfully and delivered up to be given an ignominious and horrible death. Crucifiction, the death consigned to thieves and assasins was decreed on the only human being to walk blamelessly on this earth, even the creator of this world, and there, on Calvary, he poured out His whole soul unto death. His great heart litteraly broke for sorrow of the sins of His people. ‘Behold the wounds in His hands His feet, the Blood and tears both mingled down. Did e’re such love and sorrow meet, or thorns compose so rich a crown?’After three days in the sepulchre, Jesus Christ, the Annointed One ressurrected to life and immortality. I testify, with the energy of my living soul, that He does, indeed, live. And by so living, all men shall live again, raised from corruption to incorruption, from death to endless life, then to be judged by the very being that suffered their cause. As a ressurrected being, He still lives, He still loves and He still speaks. After the long darkness of apostasy and absence of His holy Priesthood and men called after His holy order, He and our Eternal Father appeared to Joseph Smith and called him to be an Elias or restorer of the fulness of the Gospel. Jesus Christ has spoken again and sent forth angels to teach men the Plan of Salvation and ordain men to His Holy Order to teach these things to the rest of the children of men. I have been called to this Order, and having recieved an holy calling and ordinance, I testify, in the very name of Jesus Christ, that Jesus Christ lives. All men can grow in His holy light through repentance and holy works, and see that light grow brighter and brighter until the perfect day. As I ponder His amazing sacrifice, I am want to sing the words; ‘Love so amazing, so divine demands my heart, my life, my all.’ This is my testimony, and from henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus. That all that read may find the grace of this Jesus and reach His peace and salvation is my prayer, in the sacred name of Jesus Christ.

The members here have a good spirit about them and I feel alot of charity and care for them.  I particularly like going to sacrament meeting here.  I am trying to incorporate more testemony into my teaching and use what I study in what I teach.  It dosnt allow for alot of study on deep doctrines, so Im glad.  The bishop here says that nintey percent of apostasia(false doctrine) comes from serving missions.  Some missionaries after studying PMG(preach my gospel) and the Book of Mormon so many times start to think they know it all already and look for other things to study about.  That dosnt really help out with your testimony, and can lead to false doctrine.  Ever since I arrived on the mission it has been stressed in my mind the doctrines of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, its necessity for salvation and exaltation, and its connections with basic principles.  I love to think and ponder about the connections and interrelations of the Gospel ordinances and the rest of the plan of salvation.         Elder Eliakim is an excellent missionary and I enjoy hearing his testimony every day.  We get along well and teach well together.  The members seem to like him very much.        We are in the stage of finding people in our area.  Sometimes I dont quite know when it is appropriate to stop teaching people.  Some people dont progress.  I think I will use as a measure the willingness they have to go to church and their willingness to make and keep commitments.  We continue to find good people to teach, but I feel that I should pray a little harder -or alot harder- to find the elect of the Lord who are prepared.  A 22 year-old young man stopped us in the street the other day and asked us what he needs to do to become a member of our church.  Needless to say we got his adress and went to visit him two days later.  He and his mother are now marked for baptism, though I have suspicions about the word of wisdom.  I think I am going to apply the proverb 'pedi e recebereis' this week and see if we cant get a few more lessons with members who can help us out in getting people to church.  It worked in Itajai so it should work to some degree here as well.  It turns out that the elders quorum president here is one of Chris Challis´ companions from when he served in Belo Horizonte.  I remember Chris telling me about Rafael Coelho and his visit to florianopolis about two months before I came down here.  Small world.        Yesterday in church I looked around and saw alot of good members of the church and felt grateful for them and their love for each other.  I love to feel the pure love of Christ enter my heart and feel to some degree for others the way He does.      I hope you all have a good week.  I love you all.          Love Joseph

After looking at our numbers this week I think were going to have to be a little more agressive in our efforts to get investigators to church on sunday.  Its a hard habit to establish for people.          Elder Eliakim is still being as great a missionary as he ever was, so you have nothing to worry about there.  I think he is ready to be a senior companion as well.  He is a great missionary.  From time to time he gets a little down about people not recieving us any more, or people not keeping commitments, but I think if he has a happy companion he should always be fine.  We get along great.  Thank you for letting me serve with good companions these last three transfers.          Our area is on the verge of a breakout in missionary work.  The members are telling us about a number of people they are preparing to recieve the lessons from us.  The members are excited to give us lunches, so thats a blessing to us as well.  I think it helps out a great deal to be in such frequent contact with the missionaries.  It helps with referrals.  As I said a little earlier, its really hard to get people to go to church.  This week Im going to ask for help from several members to pick up investigators.  I find that when members go with us to teach, it does more than prepare for better retention, it also helps with people getting to church.  We have a number of investigators that are getting more and more ready for baptism, they just need to get started going to church.       Thank you and Sister Dansie for all you do for us and your help in keeping us at a strong spiritual level.  I sustain your leadership and will sustain and obey the new president as well.  Thank you for your faithful service.

Its always tough during the first week of a transfer when you dont know the members or any of the investigators, but the second week is always better.  Elder Eliakim is a good worker and always has a back up plan, so we dont end up losing a lot of time.  Ive realized just how much work is involved in saying good prayers, and it does indeed take time to get comfortable talking to the Lord and have a meaningul conversation.  I dont think that its kicked in to me yet that well be having a new mission president next transfer.  You have done and are still doing a fine job and we thank and support you.         Elder Eliakim is being a good companion and we work well together.  Its fun to talk to him and share experiences.          This area is a little different than Itajai.  People dont want to listen or recieve free pass along cards, but things are always improving as we find people who are more prepared.  I didnt think I would be any good at doing door contacts, but Im not having as many problems as I was anticipating.  I like doing missionary work.  We managed to mark people for baptism that I thought we would never be able to.  People change in the way they recieve us too.  Some people seemed cold to us when we first started teaching them, but now they seem eager to recieve us.  I did alot of studying in PMG about finding people this week and I learned more about who the elect are and how to find and identify them.  Commitments like going to church, accepting to be baptized etc can be used as a test to see if they acknowledge you as the Lords servants.  Its always a struggle to get people to go to church, but I think that if we plan a little bit better and excercise a little carisma with the members, we can achieve alot more.  The future is always smiling brightly before us.  We have found a perfect investigator that isnt living with anyone out of wedlock, breaking the PdS, and is ready to hear the message.  We have high hopes for her once she starts going to church.        Yesterday in church we were singing the last himn, (Lord I would follow thee) and I started to remember my covenants that I made in the temple to follow the savior and a personal experience and revelation I had when preparing for my mission in which I knew with a great surety that I had promised, before the foundation of this world, standing before the throne of our Father and at His right hand Jehovah, I raised my right hand and took an oath, made in gratitude and devotion to He who was chosen, that I would do my part in the Plan, that I would serve my Captain, Brother and King, regardless of cost.  That was my desire and was revealed to me and was renewed before coming on the mission.  Yesterday, as I remembered that and my temple covenants, I felt the cleansing power of the Spirit, testifying that I was fulfilling my covenants well and that the Lord acknowledes and is pleased with my work.  I was grateful, and know that there is still more I can do, in all aspects of my work, and I love to partake the sacrament and renew my covenants.  I need to repent every day.  Every day.       Thank you for your work and not being trunky and neglecting us.  Im sure the Lord is pleased with your work too, and is grateful for your desires to do his work and the way you do it.  I thank you for your influence and goodness.

Its interresting to show up in a given area and not have a clue whats going on and still work. There arent a whole lot of people in the teaching pool here, but were looking for people and I am trying to find new ways to find and teach the honest in heart.Elder Eliakim is a great missionary and I like to hear him bear his testimony. He has a purity that is undisputable. I am always glad and grateful to have a companion that works and teaches with testimony. It was good to talk with our families, and as he was talking with his family, it was apparent that he loves his parents. He told me afterwards that during sacrament meeting he felt strongly what was being said about mothers, but his thoughts were drawn more toward me and my own Mother. So he gave me a hug and told me he felt that surely my Mother must be proud of and happy with me. That meant alot to me. Thank you for letting me have a good companion. My congratulations go to Elder Jones for training an excellent missionary.This area is a little richer than Itajaí II, so Im feeling that there should be a few more struggles for me, but with the help of the LORD combined with improved and strengthened faith, it should give fruit. There arent really a whole lot of people showing good prospects for baptism or even being marked for baptism, but we found a woman this week who should be perfect. She lives alone, has no addictions, already knew members a few years back and loves to recieve our message. We also found a moça who was baptized in Porto Alegre, but moved out to the middle of no-where, where the church still didnt exist and then moved here, but never found the church. She still reads the Book of Mormon every other night and as far as I can tell is still worthy. What a blessing. It seems like every person that goes inactive ends up moving in with someone and starts smoking and has to go through a whole lot of repentance to come back to church. Also, one of our investigators who had been somewhat reluctant to change-from what E Eliakim tells me- decided to get married, stop smoking and get baptized, along with renew his broken family ties as well. In short, even though there is alot of work to be done here in regards to marked baptisms and people going to church, the Lord provides a way and if we sanctify our hearts through charity, our covenants of the Priesthood and pure testimony.I come from a large family of eleven kids. I remember that at my Mothers funeral my Dad said that he was grateful that my Mom was willing to bring so many children into the world. This week as I was praying, I realized that perhaps if my parents had decided to stop at seven kids, I would not be a part of my family, nor perhaps the Church. I am grateful for my parents willingness to give up worldly things and goods to bring up children in righteousness. I know Jesus Christ lives. I have a sacred promise made to Him to fulfill and I will always seek to improve my methods of service, that through Him, I might fill the world with light. I love him. Thank you for your testimony given in the rede. Thank you for all the things you have been doing for us as well. It is much apreciated.Our numbers this week are as follows:Bapt/Conf..........0/0Bapt mark..........6/3Pesq na igr.........1liç c memb.........15novos...............23contatos............144qualificar...........100%lemb s dist..........95%Total.................5/7

This week was good, we ate lunch with the bishop and I got to know him a bit better and I like him.  The members here have a good spirit about them and I feel alot of charity and care for them.  I particularly like going to sacrament meeting here.  I am trying to incorporate more testemony into my teaching and use what I study in what I teach.  It dosnt allow for alot of study on deep doctrines, so Im glad.  The bishop here says that nintey percent of apostasia(false doctrine) comes from serving missions.  Some missionaries after studying PMG and the Book of Mormon so many times start to think they know it all already and look for other things to study about.  That dosnt really help out with your testimony, and can lead to false doctrine.  Ever since I arrived on the mission it has been stressed in my mind the doctrines of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, its necessity for salvation and exaltation, and its connections with basic principles.  I love to think and ponder about the connections and interrelations of the Gospel ordinances and the rest of the plan of salvation.         Elder Eliakim is an excellent missionary and I enjoy hearing his testimony every day.  We get along well and teach well together.  The members seem to like him very much.        We are in the stage of finding people in our area.  Sometimes I dont quite know when it is appropriate to stop teaching people.  Some people dont progress.  I think I will use as a measure the willingness they have to go to church and their willingness to make and keep commitments.  We continue to find good people to teach, but I feel that I should pray a little harder -or alot harder- to find the elect of the Lord who are prepared.  A 22 year-old young man stopped us in the street the other day and asked us what he needs to do to become a member of our church.  Needless to say we got his adress and went to visit him two days later.  He and his mother are now marked for baptism, though I have suspicions about the word of wisdom.  I think I am going to apply the proverb 'pedi e recebereis' this week and see if we cant get a few more lessons with members who can help us out in getting people to church.  It worked in Itajaí so it should work to some degree here as well.        Yesterday in church I looked around and saw alot of good members of the church and felt grateful for them and their love for each other.  I love to feel the pure love of Christ enter my heart and feel to some degree for others the way He does.        I hope you have a good week and the spirit is close to you.  Thank you for all you do to help us in our work.  We love you and appreciate you, and will miss you when youre gone.

Its always tough during the first week of a transfer when you dont know the members or any of the investigators, but the second week is always better.  Im glad that Dad got home safely.  This morning our zone went to the mole beach on the other side of the Island.  It is really beautiful here, and me, e Eliakim(my comp), one of the aps our lz and the financial secretary went exploring along the coast.  It was fun and a little dirty, so it felt good to get dirty again for the first time in ....  We found a bunch of anti social wild billy goats and a group of fisherman living in the middle of nowhere and every bodys sandals broke on the rocks, except for mine because I went bare foot, and we all discovered that mature aloe vera has sharp spines.  It grows every where in the hills!  We all agreed that it was a good adventure.  (every good adventure has to have a part where you get a good view of nature and get los in the process).  Our lz, E Borup, kept saying there was a neighbor hood with a bus stop on the other side of the hill, but when we got to the top, all we saw was coast and hills for miles.  We had fun.                  This area is a little different than Itajai.  People dont want to listen or recieve free pass along cards, but things are always improving as we find people who are more prepared.  I didnt think I would be any good at doing door contacts, but Im not having as many problems as I was anticipating.  I like doing missionary work.  We managed to mark people for baptism that I thought we would never be able to.  People change in the way they recieve us too.

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Hellooooo!From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 28 Apr 2008 15:43:20 +0000Elder AndrewsElder PimentelItajai 2Zona ItajaiDear Family,       This week passed by very fast.  My companion and I were rushed to contact our investigators with zone conference and d-day all in the same week, but I think we managed to get along pretty well and teach with a powerfull spirit to our investigators.  I feel a little more receptive to the spirit and easier to feel charity for people and it helps significantly with what I do.  This week I made the goal to have a doctrine of the day on which to ponder and teach if I have to give a short message.  It also helps to keep your mind on the saviour.  On thursday I studied Baptism in Preach my Gospel, and I didnt make it past the phrase ''baptism is the first ordinance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  An ordinance is a ceremony or rite that shows we make a covenant with Heavenly Father.''  I started to think about what a ceremony is.  The three common characteristics of ceremonies are as folows; someone in authority realizes the ceremony and oversees the covenants, the parties involved and witnesses.  This is true in regard to weddings, change of command in the military, award ceremonies etc.  The Change of command in a rifle company in the US ARMY is notably interresting.  While an officer may recieve a certain rank, such as Captain, this does not necessarily mean he is in a given command, but must recieve command over a body of men.  When this happens, there is a ceremony in front of the group recieveing a new commander, showing that from the moment the flag of the rifle company is passed from one Captain to another, the new captain is in command.  While paper work has to be filled out to authorize the change, the change is in effect from the ceremony on.  When we read section 128 of the Doctrine and covenants, we see quite plainly that we are judged according to men in the flesh (here we could say that the ceremony of baptism is to show to the witnesses or congregation and to God that we enter into the covenants of baptism) and according to God in the spirit, by what is written.  The ordinances of the Temple could be seen like a captain, who already possesing AUTHORITY, recieves an Oath and a Covenant in the presence of the supreme command and is endowed with POWER from on high.  Ordinances are absolutley necessary in our knowing God the Eternal Father and His son, Jesus Christ.       A few days ago we visited a family we are teaching who are going through financial problems and are struggleing with smoking and have been a little depressed with a slow down in their progress, so we visited them to help them.  I dint feel particularly inspired to teach on a given doctrine so I just asked them if they had any questions.  They didnt say any thing so I just waited.  And waited.  I noticed that the wife had tears in her Eyes.  So I waited some more and Roberto started to tell me how htey were passing through difficulties and how we hear alot about people being called or chosen and how they didnt know if they were among the chosen.  They said alot of other things as well, but I dont remember them.  I told them how I had passed through many problems, heartaches and times of hopelessness myself and I read them a scripture that helped me meny times in D+C 121.  I felt many things and spoke alot of things from my heart and told them that we are the ones that choose if we are chosen.  Some hear and turn away from the voice of the spirit, but others choose to embrace it.  The Lord, it seems, does not care so much about achievment so mush as he does about what we are doing.  Then we gave each of them a blessing and I prayed for them.  I love to pray for others and feel charity fill my heart as I act in the name of the Savior and speak his will and love for others.        On saturday night we got back from D-day in Balneario and We passed by a members house to ask if they could teach with us, but he was a bit sick and they offered a snack which we accepted.  I think there was some high tention in the home, and their 20 year old son yelled at his mom.  I felt a little saddened at this as well as Elder Pimentel.  We both sat down on the couch to see where we could go to teach, and our plans seemed futile, so we prayed for inspiration on what to do.  I didnt have any ideas and Elder Pimentel was still praying. Then he stopped and asked if we could leave a message with the family.  Half of what follows is what E. pimentel told me afterwards, so, while he was praying to know where we should go, he felt that we shluld stay just where we were.  So following the spirit, he took the hymn book and grabbed Rafael(the son who yelled at his mom) and asked him to sing I Am A Child of God with him.  so the two of them sang and then the two of them kneeled and prayed, and after that E Pimentel told Rafael to give his Mother a hug and ask forgivness and never disrepect her again.  As my companino did all this, he did it with a profound humility and perfect love, which not even a 20 yearold young man could deny and I did not see Elder Pimentel speaking, But Jesus Christ.  After that, Elder pimentel spoke to the the family and asked them to love each other and never let that happen again in their home.  He spoke of his won family and how he showed love to them every day and eles acobraram quando ele nao mostrou seu amor para eles.  He said that this family was sealed and they should honor and cherish that blessing.  He said none of his family but him is a member so he dosnt know the blessing of having an eternal family, and he pointed to me and said that I do and I have a great blessing in my life.  I felt powerfully a deep sorrow and an even deeper desire to help E Pimentels family recieve this blessing.  I also bore testimony of how we should cultivate love in the home, and how if we dont, we may drive those we love from us, especially through judgment and sarcarsm.  I asked if I could pray at the end, and I prayed for each of the people in the family present and E. Pimentels family as well.  We have acted in the name of Jesus Christ this week and we feel the sanctifying power of representing him as best we can through Faith Hope and Charity.  Humility is the key, and as it says in Hel 3:35 We deliver our hearts to Him through Prayer.  Every thing begins with prayer.  It is my testimony that we may be sanctifyied through our prayer, humility, Faith hope and especially Charity, and that we are qualified for hte work when we wholly take upon us the Holy name of Christ.       I love you

These last two weeks have been a little rough, espiecially in the way of getting our investigators to church, and our numbers had fallen a good deal too, so I was a little worried that we might finish the transfer badly, so we worked a little harder, walked a little faster and in the end we were blessed with good numbers.  I have taken note that when your investigators dont go to church for a few weeks, they weaken and you have to start a few things over again.  I have been studying the Oath and Covenant of the Priesthood and its relation with the temple ceremonies with a result of a more keen awareness of what it means to be called as a missionary, what my authority and obligations are etc.  I feel more empowered in knowing that I am endued with power from on high.       Transfers are interresting things as you feel sorrow in parting with friends, but I never feel a real loss of hope for the future.  Its kind of like getting a mission call all over again.  Your heart aches at leaving, but when you hear where youre going, the spirit give you a confirmation that that is where youre needed and you desire to go there.  I thank you for letting Elder Pimentel and I serve together for two transfers, I have learned and grown much with him.  I also thank you for not putting him with a great fubecca.  Elder Bateman is a good missionary, or at least was in the CTM.  Im sure they will do great here.  I will miss our bishop here.  We didnt spend a whole lot of time wiht him, but alot of the members are kind of scared to be social with him since hes on the swat team.       The area here is doing well, we still have a few people that have to quit smoking and others that are waiting for the paper work for marraige.  During the next two transfers there should be some eight or nine baptisms if we all keep working as hard as possible.  We are processing the paper work for seven marraiges.  That will be fun.  I have seen miracles here, and have found many of hte Honest in Heart.        My uncle wrote a song a few years back wanting to portray Joseph Smiths vision of zion;          I see our Zion, with hills surrounded          Where evry family will dwell in peace          A place of beauty and pure devotion          Where praise to Him will never cease          There are no poor or hurt among us          The meek and weary will there have rest          And every heart that has been broken          Is surely healed in righteousness          Oh can you see the place Im seeing ?          Oh can you hear Him call you there?          Oh can you feel His arms around you          And His pure love find everywhere?          We shall fall down and kiss His feet,          Be crowned with glory, pure light well find          And heavenly angels will throng the temples          And join with us to save mankind          Oh can you see the place Im seeing?          Oh can you hear Him call you there?          Oh can you feel His arms around you          And His pure love find evrywhere?            Oh can you see the place Im seeing?          What we see now is just the start,          Go share this news with evry people          And gather in the pure in heart.       I wish the members here could feel the vision of Zion, of being one in Heart and Mind, having no poor among us.  Some people just think that the church exists to help us financially as an organization, and their testimony rests on this, but through the Ordinances of the melkisedek priesthood, or through the temple, we have the opportunity to know God.      ''...Eis que [Deus] viu que era conviniente que os homens soubessem das coisas que decretara para eles.  Enviou, portanto, anjos para conversarem com eles, os quais fizeram com que os homens contemplassem sua gloria.  E dali em diante começaram a invocar seu nome; portanto Deus conversou com os homens e revelou lhes o plano de redenção... (Alma 12:28-30)     ''E ... desaria chamar vossa atenção para a epoca em que o Senhor transmitiu estes mandamentos a seus filhos; e quisera que lembrasseis de que o Senhor Deus ordenou sacerdotes segundo a sua santa ordem, que era segundo a ordem de seu Filho, para que ensinassem estas coisas ao povo.'' (Alma 13:1)      We have recieved an endowment with power from on high with a responsibility to teach these things -the plan of salvation and the Gospel of Jesus Christ, which has been restored in these latter days- to all people, and we have been called with a holy calling and ordained with a holy ordinance, taking upon us the name of Christ.  My responsibility is very, very great, but if I can have faith, hope and charity, which charity and hope can come through a remission of sins, I can do His work effectivley.  So seeing this, Whenever I read the scriptures, it seems like all im reading are the words- repent. repent. repent. repent. etc.  I am grateful for the glorious opportunity to have the Gospel in my life, and the even greater opportunity to be a missionary and diciple of Jesus Christ the Son of God, being called of him to declare his word among his people, that they may have everlasting life.

Transfers are always an interresting experience if not absolutly humbling.  Its interresting to show up in a given area and not have a clue whats going on and still work.  There arent a whole lot of people in the teaching pool here, but were looking for people and I am trying to find new ways to find and teach the honest in heart.        Elder Eliakim is a great missionary and I like to hear him bear his testimony.  He has a purity that is undisputable.  I am always glad and grateful to have a companion that works and teaches with testimony.  It was good to talk with our families, and as he was talking with his family, it was apparent that he loves his parents.  He told me afterwards that during sacrament meeting he felt strongly what was being said about mothers, but his thoughts were drawn more toward me and my own Mother.  So he gave me a hug and told me he felt that surely my Mother must be proud of and happy with me.  That meant alot to me.  I am glad to have a good companion all over again.  We both have eyebrows para caramba, so we make quite the team.        This area is a little richer than Itajaí II, and today after playing soccer with the rest of the zone, we found a music shop with a cello, so I stopped in and asked if I could play.  When I asked for a bow they gave me a violin bow.  I like it here.  Places that are richer generally are a little harder so Im feeling that there should be a few more struggles for me here, but with the help of the LORD combined with improved and strengthened faith, it should give fruit.  There arent really a whole lot of people showing good prospects for baptism or even being marked for baptism, but we found a woman this week who should be perfect.  She lives alone, has no addictions, already knew members a few years back and loves to recieve our message.  We also found a moça who was baptized in Porto Alegre, but moved out to the middle of no-where, where the church still didnt exist and then moved here, but never found the church.  She still reads the Book of Mormon every other night and as far as I can tell is still worthy.  What a blessing.  It seems like every person that goes inactive ends up moving in with someone and starts smoking and has to go through a whole lot of repentance to come back to church.  Also, one of our investigators who had been somewhat reluctant to change-from what E Eliakim tells me- decided to get married, stop smoking and get baptized, along with renew his broken family ties as well.

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Agronomica, Elder AndrewsFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: mp8-dansiel@lds.netDate: Mon, 12 May 2008 18:47:17 +0000Elder AndrewsElder EliakimAgronomicaZona FlorianopolisDear President Dansie,      Transfers are always an interresting experience if not absolutly humbling.  Its interresting to show up in a given area and not have a clue whats going on and still work.  There arent a whole lot of people in the teaching pool here, but were looking for people and I am trying to find new ways to find and teach the honest in heart.        Elder Eliakim is a great missionary and I like to hear him bear his testimony.  He has a purity that is undisputable.  I am always glad and grateful to have a companion that works and teaches with testimony.  It was good to talk with our families, and as he was talking with his family, it was apparent that he loves his parents.  He told me afterwards that during sacrament meeting he felt strongly what was being said about mothers, but his thoughts were drawn more toward me and my own Mother.  So he gave me a hug and told me he felt that surely my Mother must be proud of and happy with me.  That meant alot to me.  Thank you for letting me have a good companion.  My congratulations go to Elder Jones for training an excellent missionary.        This area is a little richer than Itajaí II, so Im feeling that there should be a few more struggles for me, but with the help of the LORD combined with improved and strengthened faith, it should give fruit.  There arent really a whole lot of people showing good prospects for baptism or even being marked for baptism, but we found a woman this week who should be perfect.  She lives alone, has no addictions, already knew members a few years back and loves to recieve our message.  We also found a moça who was baptized in Porto Alegre, but moved out to the middle of no-where, where the church still didnt exist and then moved here, but never found the church.  She still reads the Book of Mormon every other night and as far as I can tell is still worthy.  What a blessing.  It seems like every person that goes inactive ends up moving in with someone and starts smoking and has to go through a whole lot of repentance to come back to church.  Also, one of our investigators who had been somewhat reluctant to change-from what E Eliakim tells me- decided to get married, stop smoking and get baptized, along with renew his broken family ties as well.  In short, even though there is alot of work to be done here in regards to marked baptisms and people going to church, the Lord provides a way and if we sanctify our hearts through charity, our covenants of the Priesthood and pure testimony.       I come from a large family of eleven kids.  I remember that at my Mothers funeral my Dad said that he was grateful that my Mom was willing to bring so many children into the world.  This week as I was praying, I realized that perhaps if my parents had decided to stop at seven kids, I would not be a part of my family, nor perhaps the Church.  I am grateful for my parents willingness to give up worldly things and goods to bring up children in righteousness.  I know Jesus Christ lives.  I have a sacred promise made to Him to fulfill and I will always seek to improve my methods of service, that through Him, I might fill the world with light.  I love him.  Thank you for your testimony given in the rede.  Thank you for all the things you have been doing for us as well.  It is much apreciated.       Our numbers this week are as follows:Bapt/Conf..........0/0Bapt mark..........6/3Pesq na igr.........1liç c memb.........15novos...............23contatos............144qualificar...........100%lemb s dist..........95%Total.................5/7

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: To the family AndrewsFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 21 Apr 2008 15:57:00 +0000Dear Family,      This week was tough, but I survived.  We had trouble getting the members to make visits this week and when they did go with us it seemed that nobody was home anyways.  We did a service project that ate up a bunch of our time, but we managed to rip out a trunk/root of an avacado tree.  It takes alot of digging and axeifying, and leaves you with alot of sore muscles if youre out of the habit of physical labor.  We now have six marraiges planned to take place in late may and all of june, so our bishop will know how to marry people verry well by the end of summer.  One of our investigators managed to convince her ''husband'' to marry her and made him get down on his knees and propose to her.  She called us afterwards to tell us that he said yes.  I congratulated her for being a bride, or for ficar noiva.  Its funny that even after living together for twenty years and having four children, there is still doubt over whether they will say yes or no, and that the doubt is actually valid!        I think I will be transferred before mothers day, its pretty rare for people to stay in an area for more than six months.  Im pretty sure I can call you guys or you can call me using skype these days.  Its alot cheaper so I hear.  I will look into that as it may be better for me to call you guys on mothers day.      I think Ive forgotten what the national convention is and what it does.  Did Dad put his name in for election or did someone else?  That would be really interresting for him to make it in as a delegate.  When I did the whole model UN thing a few years back I enjoyed the chaos of being on a committee, making resolutions and enemies etc.  It can be alot of fun.        Yesterday we had a stunning two investigators in church, and only because we chased them down in the rain and brang them to church.  If not, we would have had zip.  Rain is bad news for missnionaries on sundays.  Last week we had ten times as many investigators in church.  We call this the peak and trough effect found in waves, which means -hopefully- this week will be better.  Itajai is a city built on the plain, in fact, it is the flattest place ive ever seen in my life, and I grew up in kansas, so it floods extremely easily.  We gave up walking for swimming yesterday...        Well I hope youre all having a great time up there, Im enjoying the cold again while youre getting into the warm part of the year.  Here in six months well all want to trade places again.  Have a good week, and remember to pray, read the scriptures and take the sacrament every week.  Its all true.  I guarantee it.            Love, Elder Andrews

I enjoyed interviews, our zone put together some goals as a zone and the spirit was strong, but throughout the week, I felt as if the other side was working with everything theyve got against us.  Most of our plans fell through and progress in general was slowed.  I fear for alot of our investigators' faith and we have to work to keep them strong, but this week we had a really hard time getting a hold of them.  I am reading the Book of Mormon and am in the book of Helaman.  I never had that much interest in the sermon by Samuel the Lamanite, but I payed attention this time.  I found some interesting doctrine about spiritual death and second death in chapter 14 verses 15-18.  I think alot on the plan of salvation, and what part I play, and how all parts in the plan interact perfectly.  It is not a plan created by mortal man but by Gods.        My companion and I get along well, and I think one of hte things that helps is obedience and a mutual desire to be obedient.  If every missionary was just obedient, his life and mission would be easy and he wouldnt have as many serious problems with his companions.  Elder Pimentel is a fabulous missnionary and one of my favorite attributes in him is his constant and driving desire to improve in all aspects of all things that he does.  He is humble.  He teaches with the spirit and with true charity for the people to whom he is talking.  I like to be his companion and hope he likes serving with me as well.  I am trying to improve my teaching skills and use some of his techniques as well.        We have roughly six marraiges planned for late may and june, which will be followed by baptisms.  One of our investigators managed to convince her husband/cohabitator to marry her and made him get down on his knees and propose to her.  She called us afterwards to tell us that he said yes.  I congratulated her for for ficar noiva.  Its funny that even after living together for twenty years and having four children, there is still doubt over whether they will say yes or no, and that the doubt is actually valid!  He had already said no several times in the past, so I think the Lord is helping her out.  He is a non active member, and refuses to see us, yet he is slowly softening to the church from what Naiza(a noiva) tells us.  Its really easy to teach and baptize women and children, but men are extremely difficult to help accept change.  Women and children usally go through a cahnge of heart or something, but most men are straight out transformed and reborn through the gospel.  It takes work.  Yesterday we chased all of our investigators down to take them to church, but only two came.  If we just sat in the chapel waiting, we wouldnt have had even one.  Rain on sundays dosnt usally help the missionaries it seems. This week ought to be better.        Our numbers this week were low despite our efforts.  We should have done more contacts.Bapt/conf....................0/0bapt marc....................15/6pesq na igr...................2liç c memb...................20novos pesq...................19lemb se dis...................90%qualificar.....................100%contatos......................45Im especially ashamed to admit our numbers for contacts.

These past weeks have been excellent to say the least.  Ive been learning more and more about the importance of going to church.  Being a missionary makes you really ask yourself why we do certain things and makes us realize the importance of small and simple things, and what they really signify to us, like the importance of talking the sacrament.  My personal studies are improving and I feel the spirit and its whisperings more frequently and strongly as I try to keep my sacrament covenants throughout the days and weeks.        My companion and I are doing well together, we treat each other as equals, and share what we have.  I think if all the missionaries divided money for food and made and ate breakfast together it would make a big difference in their unity and amizade.  They would feel more of the spirit that comes with selflessness and unity.  I like working with Elder Pimentel.        This week we had a baptism, Antonio, who finally overcame the habit of smoking.  I want to teach more to him in regards to repentance of breaking the word of wisdom after baptism just in case he suffers a relapse.  I think if people really understood the process of repentance before baptism, their would be less inactive people in Brasil.  Anyways, there wasnt enough water stored up above the ceiling to fill the font, so we went to a less active members house to do the baptism in the pool there.  Seeing as the water was neck-high, there were no worries about Antonios knees coming up out of the water, so that was nice.  We have a number of coulples who are waiting to be married to be baptized and are in the process of getting all the paper work done, and should be married and baptized in about forty days or so.  Bishop Poerner here should be a professional at doing marraiges by the end of june...  We are also teaching a member who should be an investigator and her daughter and friend as well.  The member, Osmarina, smokes, drinks and is converting to Assembleia, because of their signs, prophecies and gifts of tongues etc. and is interrupting a great deal in our lesson to her daughter, who is very interrested in the church.  I dont wish to prod or request any thing unnecessary, but there are many good people who are decieved by the signs in other churches, and many other churches are good, but others, while professing the name of Christ are filled with evil spirits-literally.  Would it be at all possible for you to give training to the missionaries on these subjects?  If not, I suppose most of the answers can be found in section fifty of the Doctrine and Covenants.       Our numbers this week are as follows;                     meta                           realizadaBat/conf         1/3.......................1/3bat marc         20/8.....................16/7pesq na igreja 20........................19liç c memb      40........................48novos pesq     37.........................40contatos         185.......................125qualificar        100%.....................100%lembre-se       95%.......................90%7/8This week we will being doing better on our contacts and marking people for baptism.  have a good week, well see you in interviews.

My companion and I were rushed to contact our investigators with zone conference and d-day all in the same week, but I think we managed to get along pretty well and teach with a powerfull spirit to our investigators.  I feel a little more receptive to the spirit and easier to feel charity for people and it helps significantly with what I do.  This week I made the goal to have a doctrine of the day on which to ponder and teach if I have to give a short message.  It also helps to keep your mind on the saviour.  On thursday I studied Baptism in Preach my Gospel, and I didnt make it past the phrase ''baptism is the first ordinance of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  An ordinance is a ceremony or rite that shows we make a covenant with Heavenly Father.''  I started to think about what a ceremony is.  The three common characteristics of ceremonies are as folows; someone in authority realizes the ceremony and oversees the covenants, the parties involved and witnesses.  This is true in regard to weddings, change of command in the military, award ceremonies etc.  The Change of command in a rifle company in the US ARMY is notably interresting.  While an officer may recieve a certain rank, such as Captain, this does not necessarily mean he is in a given command, but must recieve command over a body of men.  When this happens, there is a ceremony in front of the group recieveing a new commander, showing that from the moment the flag of the rifle company is passed from one Captain to another, the new captain is in command.  While paper work has to be filled out to authorize the change, the change is in effect from the ceremony on.  When we read section 128 of the Doctrine and covenants, we see quite plainly that we are judged according to men in the flesh (here we could say that the ceremony of baptism is to show to the witnesses or congregation and to God that we enter into the covenants of baptism) and according to God in the spirit, by what is written.  The ordinances of the Temple could be seen like a captain, who already possesing AUTHORITY, recieves an Oath and a Covenant in the presence of the supreme command and is endowed with POWER from on high.  Ordinances are absolutley necessary in our knowing God the Eternal Father and His son, Jesus Christ.       I like serving with Elder Pimentel, he has a special spirit when he teaches.  I know that I have been here for a while, but I would like to request one more transfer with him here.  If we are needed elsewhere, I understand, and accept the call to another area, but we would like to serve together as long as possible.  We love serving one next to the other.  I feel as if were ready to train and everything.  He is perfect and I am humbled to seve with him.       We now have six or seven people ready for baptism as soon as their paper work for marraige goes through.  We have to work hard for them to keep them strong.  The members continue to help, though not as much as before.  But we only have reasons to be grateful for them.       A few days ago we visited a family we are teaching who are going through financial problems and are struggleing with smoking and have been a little depressed with a slow down in their progress, so we visited them to help them.  I dint feel particularly inspired to teach on a given doctrine so I just asked them if they had any questions.  They didnt say any thing so I just waited.  And waited.  I noticed that the wife had tears in her Eyes.  So I waited some more and Roberto started to tell me how htey were passing through difficulties and how we hear alot about people being called or chosen and how they didnt know if they were among the chosen.  They said alot of other things as well, but I dont remember them.  I told them how I had passed through many problems, heartaches and times of hopelessness myself and I read them a scripture that helped me meny times in D+C 121.  I felt many things and spoke alot of things from my heart and told them that we are the ones that choose if we are chosen.  Some hear and turn away from the voice of the spirit, but others choose to embrace it.  The Lord, it seems, does not care so much about achievment so mush as he does about what we are doing.  Then we gave each of them a blessing and I prayed for them.  I love to pray for others and feel charity fill my heart as I act in the name of the Savior and speak his will and love for others.        On saturday night we got back from D-day in Balneario and We passed by a members house to ask if they could teach with us, but he was a bit sick and they offered a snack which we accepted.  I think there was some high tention in the home, and their 20 year old son yelled at his mom.  I felt a little saddened at this as well as Elder Pimentel.  We both sat down on the couch to see where we could go to teach, and our plans seemed futile, so we prayed for inspiration on what to do.  I didnt have any ideas and Elder Pimentel was still praying. Then he stopped and asked if we could leave a message with the family.  Half of what follows is what E. pimentel told me afterwards, so, while he was praying to know where we should go, he felt that we shluld stay just where we were.  So following the spirit, he took the hymn book and grabbed Rafael(the son who yelled at his mom) and asked him to sing I Am A Child of God with him.  so the two of them sang and then the two of them kneeled and prayed, and after that E Pimentel told Rafael to give his Mother a hug and ask forgivness and never disrepect her again.  As my companino did all this, he did it with a profound humility and perfect love, which not even a 20 yearold young man could deny and I did not see Elder Pimentel speaking, But Jesus Christ.  After that, Elder pimentel spoke to the the family and asked them to love each other and never let that happen again in their home.  He spoke of his won family and how he showed love to them every day and eles acobraram quando ele nao mostrou seu amor para eles.  He said that this family was sealed and they should honor and cherish that blessing.  He said none of his family but him is a member so he dosnt know the blessing of having an eternal family, and he pointed to me and said that I do and I have a great blessing in my life.  I felt powerfully a deep sorrow and an even deeper desire to help E Pimentels family recieve this blessing.  I also bore testimony of how we should cultivate love in the home, and how if we dont, we may drive those we love from us, as happened in my family after my own mother died.  I asked if I could pray at the end, and I prayed for each of the people in the family present and E. Pimentels family as well.  We have acted in the name of Jesus Christ this week and we feel the sanctifying power of representing him as best we can through Faith Hope and Charity.  Humility is the key, and as it says in Hel 3:35 We deliver our hearts to Him through Prayer.  Every thing begins with prayer.  It is my testimony that we may be sanctifyied through our prayer, humility, Faith hope and especially Charity, and that we are qualified for hte work when we wholly take upon us the Holy name of Christ.       Thank you for all you do for us.  We sustain you and pray for you.       Our numbers this week were as follows;                   meta                   realbapt/conf    0/0.................0/0bapt marc    20/8...............16/7Pesq na ig   15..................3liç c mem     35..................24novos          35..................23contatos      170.................163qualificar     100%...............100%Lem se dis   95%.................90%Total          6/7               Our weeks have gotten harder to achieve our goals, but we will be better this week.  We prayed for the rain to stop on saturday night so that people would come to church and it stopped raining.  When we went to pick up our investigators ate com carro, they didnt come.  Oh well, we did our part.  Hve a great week.

I think when Im transferred Ill be a little sad to leave, because this area treats me well.  Last night when I reported our numbers to the zone leaders, I was pretty shocked to see how much weve been blessed.  It is definately not just us working here, because its pretty much impossible to do it on your own.  The members have been helping us like who knows what.        So Aurelia cut her hair short huh?  Youll have to send pictures(you can email digital photos to me via myldsmail.net without any problems).  This week we did a service project at a members house.  I dont think they throw anything away.  I got to chop a tree stump out of the ground with a really dull axe, and the next morning when I woke up all the muscles in my back were more or less ridiculously sore.  Im feeling the consequences of eleven months without physical labor.  I should probably excercise more.  We had another baptism on saturday, but somebody with a nasty sense of humor shut off the water valve to the church, so the big tubs of water that store water above the roof were empty, which means there was no water to fill the font.  So we had the baptism at an inactive members pool.  It was a little different, but seeing as the water was neck-high there were no worries about the investigators knees sticking out of the water or anything.        Im glad to hear Charles is still having good luck with cars.  Loosing wheels is always fun...  Why is Erin having jaw surgery?        I hope you all have a good week.  I took a look at the date the other day and realized that mothers day is coming up.  It seems like yesterday was christmas.  Time really flies!  Eu amo voces e espero que tenham uma boa semana!           Love Elder Andrews

At the end, one of the elders watching with me comented that President Monson never cited the scriptures once in his three talks. I found that interresting, but it dosnt really make a difference. As Brigham Young said in response to someone saying that the standard works should be the base of all doctrine and how we teach, the written word is from the past, the spoken word from the living oracle of God, is current, is Doctrine, and he would rather have a prophet than all the records ever written cobined. Authority dosnt come from the scriptures as Elder Holland explained so thoroughly. Im grateful to have a Prophet and I sustain President Monson as our President, Prophet, Seer, and revelator.My companion and I get along just fine, though sometimes he talks with perhaps a little excess and dosnt really leave me time to say much, and this week I realized that I was getting a little mad at him for it during one of our lessons, and when the time came around for me to teach I had lost the spirit because I was angry over something so petty. So after really repenting during the lesson, I was able to teach with the spirit. This really taught me that I do need to be more humble, and always have a broken heart and a contrite spirit, remembering Christ, and this will open the way to having the spirit, which brings charity. One of my biggest faults would be pride, and as I have been studying Alma and his prayers and sermons, his chief key to success was humility, a broken heart and contrite spirit, and pure charity. The focus of his talks seems to always point to being humble, being grateful for past deliverance. My attitude toward my companion improves as I humble myself and regard him as an equal.This week we visited an investigator and his brother who is a member who is new here and hasnt come to church in a month. It turns out that he was offended that the church didnt give him any financial help when he arrived and has decided to not go to church. He never spoke to the Bishop about it, just left a message in the voice mail, nor did he give his adress to the Bishop etc. But he was determined that the bishop has been neglecting his responsibilities and has decided not to go to church. So I asked him why he decided to be baptized fifteen years ago. He said he did what he needed to do for his personal salvation, so he was baptized. So I asked him what the Sacrament is to him.

At the end, one of the elders watching with me comented that President Monson never cited the scriptures once in his three talks.  I found that interresting, but it dosnt really make a difference.  As Brigham Young said in response to someone saying that the standard works should be the base of all doctrine and how we teach, the written word is from the past, the spoken word from the living oracle of God, is current, is Doctrine, and he would rather have a prophet than all the records ever written cobined.  Authority dosnt come from the scriptures as Elder Holland explained so thoroughly.  Im grateful to have a Prophet and I sustain President Monson as our President, Prophet, Seer, and revelator.        My companion and I get along just fine, though sometimes he talks with perhaps a little excess and dosnt really leave me time to say much, and this week I realized that I was getting a little mad at him for it during one of our lessons, and when the time came around for me to teach I had lost the spirit because I was angry over something so petty.  So after really repenting during the lesson, I was able to teach with the spirit.  This really taught me that I do need to be more humble, and always have a broken heart and a contrite spirit, remembering Christ, and this will open the way to having the spirit, which brings charity.  One of my biggest faults would be pride, and as I have been studying Alma and his prayers and sermons, his chief key to success was humility, a broken heart and contrite spirit, and pure charity.  The focus of his talks seems to always point to being humble, being grateful for past deliverance.  My attitude toward my companion improves as I humble myself and regard him as an equal.        This week we visited an investigator and his brother who is a member who is new here and hasnt come to church in a month.  It turns out that he was offended that the church didnt give him any financial help when he arrived and has decided to not go to church.  He never spoke to the Bishop about it, just left a message in the voice mail, nor did he give his adress to the Bishop etc.  But he was determined that the bishop has been neglecting his responsibilities and has decided not to go to church.  So I asked him why he decided to be baptized fifteen years ago.  He said he did what he needed  to do for his personal salvation, so he was baptized.  So I asked him what the Sacrament is to him.  He scoffed and said it dosnt really matter because half the time nobody partakes of it with a contrite spirit and a broken heart like were supposed to any way.  Ive come to realize that alot of people look at the church as just another church, or think it is the true church just because we help the poor, but the moment they demand help, if it does not come efficiently, they fall, and reject the Lords servants, such as the bishop.  Our church is true based on the fact that we have the authority to administer the ordinances of the gospel through the high priesthood, which holds the keys to the know-lede of God, which is eternal life, and without the ordinances (the sacrament for example) ''and the authority of the priesthood, the power of godliness is not manifested to men in the flesh; therefore, without this no man can see the face of God the Father, and live...''  This experience really shook me in regards to how much sand is under the foudations of alot of ''mature'' members of the church in regards to their testimonies of the church, so I am focusing much of my efforts with active, less active and non members to see the importance of having prophets; living apostles who are the oracles of God here upon the earth and that the Gospel of Jesus Christ wit all its ordinances is restored and administered by the same organization of priesthood authority as set forth by Jesus Christ himself two thousand years ago, and even since the before the world existed.         We have an investigator who it looks like will be baptized this saturday, and many others who are working on the paper work for marraige.

Especially because I got to see the last three sessions of conference in english.  I feel that it is exceedingly better to watch it in your native language.  I enjoyed the strong spirit given especially through the first presidency, as well as their humor.  President Monson caught me a little by surprise with his ears, but he proved a good point with the fact that people watch and follow our examples.  One of the missionaries watching with me commented at the end that in the three talks given by the president, he cited no scriptures.  I almost gave him a lecture to read the chapter in the Joseph Smith manual about prophets and continuing revelation along with D&amp;C 68, but I didnt.  Authority dosnt come from the scriptures as Elder Ballard explained so thoroughly.  I enjoy, and have been enjoying greatly the talks given by President Eyring since his call to the first presidency.  His humility brings on pure doctrine and a spirit that is very remarkable.       Anyway, Ill get along with it and tell you all how Im doing.  This week was bad in comparison to our last month, but when looking at what weve achieved, Id say we are still doing pretty well.  This week were going to do better and be a little humbler.  We visited a member this week who is new here and hasnt come to church in a month.  It turns out that he was offended that the church didnt give him any financial help when he arrived and has decided to not go to church.  He never spoke to the Bishop about it.  So I asked him why he decided to be baptized fifteen years ago.  He said he did what he needed  to do for his personal salvation, so he was baptized.  So I asked him what the Sacrament is to him.  He scoffed and said it dosnt really matter because half the time nobody partakes of it with a contrite spirit and a broken heart like were supposed to any way.

This experience really shook me in regards to how much sand is under alot of ''mature'' members of the church in regards to their testimonies of the church, so I am focusing much of my efforts with active, less active and non members to see the importance of haveing prophets, living apostles who are the oracles of God here upon the earth and that the Gospel of Jesus Christ is restored and administered by the same organization of priesthood authority as set forth by Jesus Christ himself two thousand years ago, and even since the before the world existed.       ''Some people just dont get it.''      During our district meeting on tuesday I switched up the program and spoke on using time effectivley using goals, and how to set effective goals.  I cant resist giving training on effective use of time based on what I did with FranklinCovey.  I think it turned out pretty well for changing the program the moment of.  I really enjoy serving as a missionary, especially when I have an excellent companion who always looks for self improvment.  Thank you all for your financial and prayerful help.  I love you all and Pray for you as well.  May the Lord bless you in all your righteous endeavors.             Love                      Elder Andrews          PS.  Im kind of surprised to see Big Red without a mustache.  Hes been around just about as long as MoTab has sung at conference.  Im glad Aurelia keeps up the tradition of send a txt every time she sees him.  If I could send txts, you all would have recieved one too;  ''BIG RED''!  Tchau.

Last week we had a super pday across the river at the new chapel in Navegantes.  They have a new imported kawai keyboard that playes the hymns by playing one key.  one of the other elders likes to sing, so while every one else was playing soccer, we stayed in the chapel and sang.  It was good to sing out with another person who sings well.  Brazilians dont really sing very well, and if they do, its kind of breathy, and I like to sing with my whole soul, so it was good to sing with some one who has a strong voice.  While we were singing I remembered singing with Paul Alan, Julia, Aurelia and Daniel two thanksgivigns ago ''awake awake''.  To me, there arent really things outside the gospel that give me as much joy as singing with my family.  sometimes I really miss it, but I can remember that one day, ALL of us will sing together in praise of the savior when he returns.        I want to thank you for your support, your example and the legacy you and Grandpa made and continue to make.  I hope our extended family remains close, even when we all get married and have our own families.  I love you and hope your health remains strong enough to help you fulfill your mission in life to the furthest extent possible.              Love,  Joseph

So Elder Pimentel and I decided to make goals for each of them -divided into our part and the part of the investigators- based on the Baptismal interview questions.  Basically what this means aside from helping our investigators progress faster is that each investigator has a page in the area book with six pages of supplementary documents focusing on progress.  Ive begun to use my study jounal a little more liberraly in scripture study in general.  My study journal for study itself is very well organized and I dont like to put things in that could be seen as redundant, but I have recognized a lack of spirit due to this, so Im writing more again.      I love working with Elder Pimentel and I would like to thank you for letting us stay together.  We have plans for the area.  We get along just fine and he is a good missionary.  Being with an obedient missionary makes for less stress.      We are teaching a members wife and a few neices and nephews who should be baptized on saturday.  We have several people who are only waiting to get the paper work done for marraige and they will get baptized.  All in all, the months of april and My should have at least six to eight baptisms.  Some other people have problems with smoking, so were preparing to help make goals and give as much help as possible.  The members are extremely helpful and I feel a great difference in the ward from when I got here.  President Benson said that member missionary work will raise the spirituality of the ward where it is applied and I am seeing this first hand.       This week we did a division and what we had planned didnt seem right, so I scrapped it.  I was feeling like someone in particular was in need, but I couldnt figure out who it was, so we visited a convert who hadnt been to church in a while to see how she was doing, and I think she needed the visit, but I still felt like we needed to find someone, so we prayed and followed our feelings.  Sometimes revelation comes packet at a time to allow us t obecome slowly and fully prepared for what is coming.  After an hour and a half of driving around and not finding anyone at home we finally went ot the other side of our area and visited an investigator.  We taught a good lesson and the spirit was strong.  She is very willing to ask the Lord and recieve revelation.  She then told us that she was needing the visit when we arrived.  She had just finished arguing with her mother about religion and her mother had left for a session of church at Deus e amor (she had a bad experience there when she went) and so she went to her room to sit down and fume, when we arrived.  It was a two sided miracle.  It  was a good thing that the members got to see how miracle like this happen so often, it always lifts them up to the work.  I know that the Lord leads the work and we are on the side that wins.    Our numbers this week were;Bapt /conf...................0/0Bapt marked.................26/8Pesq na igreja...............9lessons with member.......42Novos pesq...................40contatos......................123Lembre se disto.............81%qualificar p esp..............100%We got alot of rides from members which cuts back on our contacts, so our contacts were a little harder to get, but well use our walking time a little better from here on out.  Thanks for all you do for us, and I hope you have a good week.      I hope you all had as good an easter as I had.  The bishop asked us and the ward mission leader to speak in sacrament meeting.  Elder Pimentel gave an excellent talk about being a witness of Christ, the ward mission leader spoke about his conversion and I talked about Lazarus and my testimony of the Savior, then the Bishop asked everyone to sit as a family in their respective families and then invited the missionaries to sit with the ward mother.  After speaking on the family and how the Saviors atonement blesses families, the meeting ended.  The meeting was very powerful, and the whole ward felt different.  One of the families in the ward was sealed in the Porto Alegre temple last week.  The sister used to be kind of sarcastic and a bit pessemistic, but after they went to the temple, Ive seen a marked difference in her way of talking to people.  I really miss going to the temple, and feeling the power of godliness that is so very strongly manifest in the things we do there.       Last week we succeeded in breaking our record again for lessons with members present, something I was thinking was a bit impossible.  Im staying here in Itajai with my ''filho'', thanks to some phone calls from the bishop and a few other people as we found out last night.  Apparently the members and the bishop like us...  We love them too.  Im not too worried about our new mission president, im sure he ll make some changes, but Ive discovered that if youre obedient to your leaders, you love them and life is alot happier.        Im glad that Aurelias recital out at BYU went well.  I didnt really have doubts that she would do well.  Im sorry I forgot to wish Anna and Dad a happy birthday last week, on tuesday I saw the date (the 18th) and just about hit myself.  So happy birthday.  Everybody is getting so old so fast.  I still feel like High school was last year and Im only 19 or something.  Yeah, and my twenty second birthday is coming up in june...       Its good to hear that Charles respects traditions that go back as far as the history of cars goes; breaking tools is pretty much and Andrews family mechanics ritual by now.  So Charles met some people in the singles ward that never have driven a car?  Were they Amish?  I hope you all have a great week, I love you all and keep you in my prayers.        Love Elder Andrews

This week I had the opportunity to give several blessings.  Before I came here on the mission I loved to give blessings and speak in the name of the Lord and feel the words flow continually to my mind as I spoke, but when you have to do it in another language, things get hard.  As I learn more and speaking in portuguese becomes more natural, I am finding the same experiences as before in giving blessings.  I love to help people, especially when I am acting in the name of our Savior.  I am gratefull for the opportunity to serve as a missionary.       My companion is great, he really has a gift for speaking to people and sharing experiences, Im usually a little more reserved about sharing experiences as many times they are personal, so as he shares everone loves him.  He loves to help people and I am learning to be less shy in helping others through his example.  I respect any decision made in transfers, but I would like to express my desire to serve atleast one more transfer with him here in Itajai.        After Interviews, I put in some thought on what exactly you would like to hear in regards to our area, so I will tell you about some of our investigators:  We see many miracles in regards to encountering people to teach and people who gain testimonies over the most unikely things in the world.  We are teaching the wife of one of the irmaos in the young men presidency who was a strong catholic and didnt see any purpose in being baptized or anything special in our church.  After some time she began to think about the tithing her husband was paying and why.  After recieving a response about the church being true over tithing, she decided she wanted to be baptized and requested to start recieving the lessons.  You should have seen the look on the Bishops face when we told him.  Deer in the headlights.  She was the last person he thought would want to join the church.  We also are teaching a single woman named Luciane who we encountered in the rain four weeks ago as we were without umbrellas and hiding from the sudden rain under a soffet.  She asked us if we wanted to come in and the rest is history.  We have been visiting her and teaching her as she puts in comments like; why did the bible end?  shouldnt there be more?  etc.  four years ago she saw the missionaries and wanted to see what it was they taught, so she followed them and made a circle around the block to pass by them to see if they would talk to her.  They walked past her without saying anything.  She did the same thing and passed by them FIVE times and in the end gave up.  So Four years later WHen the missionaries showed up in the rain, she thought to herself, they came to ME!  she is accepting every thing and even burned the Jehovas witnesses that passed by and said we didnt believe in God for talking trash on other religions and lying about what we believe when she heard from our own mouths the truth.  She, like many others we teach, just needs to give up smoking.  Sometimes my heart sickens because of the vices with which satan holds the majority.  Our task sometimes seems impossible, but I remember the quote that Sister Dansie gave us a while back; We going to win.  The Lord will help us.  I will do all that is necessary to represent Christ and let his light shine through the darkness in the lives of others.        This week was ridiculously good numbers wise, but at the end of the week, my companion and I felt like we were blessed and just slacked the rest of the time.  Although this isnt true, we felt like we could have done better.  Friday through sunday I felt somthing weighing me down, like we needed to help someone in particular, but I couldnt figure out who it was, but at eight forty five last night we decided to visit a sister in the ward who signed a divorce this week.  One of the member families that we visit alot(or by way of interpretation, we pass by, talk and get a ride from him and teach lessons with him), has been telling us we need to visit this sister, but we put it off until yesterday.  We both agree that she was the one in need of a visit.  I brought my guitar(I got sick of life without music, so I bought a guitar three weeks ago and have been teaching my self in my free time.  Its fun to sing primary songs with it.) and sang two songs; Ele eviou seu filho and that one about a seed in spring which relates to the resurrection and resoration-em um dia primaveril. Then we gave her a blessing.  I think we helped her alot, shes been pretty depressed and she lives alone too.  It was good to use my talents to help someone again.  My companion has the gift of the gab, and much of what I have to say is lost in translation, so sometimes I feel like a third wheel, so again, it felt good to use my talents.  I love to live the gospel of Jesus Christ and help others on their way.  It leaves me feeling good and it really does bring ''verdade e paz, que satisfaz, o evangelho é luz''.      Our numbers this week are;Bapt/conf...........0/0bapt. marcado.....10/5pesq.s na igreja...10liç. com memb.....25novos...............28contatos............208Lembre se disto...18/22qualificar p esp....4/7All of our baptisms will probably be performed march 29 due to scheduling with the buildings and stake activities.  Elder Pimentel is on fire with contacts, he has a gift for talking to people, and we arrived a few minutes late a few nights this week.  Have a good week and we look forward to zone conference tomorrow.  Thank you for all you do to help us, it is much apreciated.            Elder Andrews

I feel like I would like to slow down time in a given day, but I cant, so we just have to be velozes.  We are focusing on helping every last one of our investigators progress, to be baptized and stay active.  Ive decided that this requires that we focus on how family worship is conducted and on how well our investigators under stand the repentace process after Baptism, and that they will make mistakes, but when you do, you just pick yourself up and start over again.  I think that the lack of understanding in these areas is one of the primary causes of lessened retention and inactivity among our converts.  Sure we introduce the atonement and get it to work in their lives, but the hard part is to get it to keep working.       My companion is great.  We work very well together and we have a bond like we were brothers.  Once again, I would like to express my VERY strong desires that we both remain here this next transfer.  I feel like we are only just now coming to realize the potential we have as a companionship.  However, if one of us is needed somewhere else, we will understand.  We commented to each other this last week that we have been seeing the hand of the enemy at work here, trying to upset our work by putting a mist of darkness around our investigators and lead them away, but we are on the winning side, and after doing all that was possible, the Lord has blessed us with miracles to answer our prayers.  One of our investigators who dosnt even know how to read, and her husband had been reading to her from the Book of Mormon, has two evangelical neighbors who already rejected us and gave us back all of our materials have been trying to get her to go to church with them.  They never have tried before we came along.  Whenever we pass by her house, her neighbors send their children to get her to come over to their house or to chuch or whatnot. One night two weeks ago one of her neighbors dropped by during one of our lessons and challenged the authority of the Book of Mormon and then left with our investiagator.  Being and evangelical, we were more or less certain that her vizinha would fill her head with doubts.  ELder Pimentel left his Guarda shuva at her house and we have been having dificulty contacting our investigator, Rose.  But this week we passed by to get the umbrella.  Rose was there and so we left a message.  I asked if E. Pimentel had a fovorite chapter in the Book of Mormon to read to her, so he chose Helaman 15.  Good chapter, but it starts off VERY uncomfortably.  So we started to explain a little about hte context and managed to get to the spiritual part and Rose interupted to tell that she had some thing to tell us.  Oh no, here comes the part where she says she dosnt want to here our message any more, we thought.  But we listened.  She said that her mother had gotten lost a few days before and so she was really worried, so her neighbor came by to pray and read a scripture to her.  She read some thing from the Bible about how the lost ones would be found in the waters or something.  Anyway, her mom pegou chuva and through all this she ended up finding her mom.  Heres the real kicker: her other neighbor never leaves the house without a Bible, but this one time she came over without it, and ROse wanted her to also read a scripture(this being after she found her mom), but there wasnt a bible in hte house so she grabbed the Book of Mormon and asked her to try reading something from it instead.  So her neighbor read from the Book of Mormon, and sure enough, it was the same scripture about the lost ones being found in the waters.  It was a small and simple thing, but it showed her that the Book of Mormon is true.  She and her whole family came to church this week.  I thought that we had lost her, that we had failed, and it had been weighing me down for almost two weeks, despite my prayers for her and her family.  That very morning I was feeling depressed about them, and had prayed extensively for them.  In all reality, The Lord does indeed answer our prayers, especially when we do all that is possible.  We have miracles like this one happen all the time, and even like I said that we see the hand of the enemy working, we see the hand of the Lord working harder and more successfully.  We have a ton of people preparing for baptism and many of them will start to be baptized beginninng on the twenty ninth of march.  Thank you for letting me serve here.       We worked very hard this week.  Our numbers are as follows:Baptisms/confirmations...........0/0Baptisms marked...................26/8Pesqisadores in church.............14Lessons with members.............40Novos pesqisadores.................32Contatos..............................203Lembre se disto......................19/22Qualificar p/ espirito................5/7Thank you for all that you do for us, have a good week.

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Letter from the illustrious elder AndrewsFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 24 Mar 2008 20:56:49 +0000Dear Family,      I hope you all had as good an easter as I had.  The bishop asked us and the ward mission leader to speak in sacrament meeting.  Elder Pimentel gave an excellent talk about being a witness of Christ, the ward mission leader spoke about his conversion and I talked about Lazarus and my testimony of the Savior, then the Bishop asked everyone to sit as a family in their respective families and then invited the missionaries to sit with the ward mother.  After speaking on the family and how the Saviors atonement blesses families, the meeting ended.  The meeting was very powerful, and the whole ward felt different.  One of the families in the ward was sealed in the Porto Alegre temple last week.  The sister used to be kind of sarcastic and a bit pessemistic, but after they went to the temple, Ive seen a marked difference in her way of talking to people.  I really miss going to the temple, and feeling the power of godliness that is so very strongly manifest in the things we do there.       Last week we succeeded in breaking our record again for lessons with members present, something I was thinking was a bit impossible.  Im staying here in Itajai with my ''filho'', thanks to some phone calls from the bishop and a few other people as we found out last night.  Apparently the members and the bishop like us...  We love them too.  Im not too worried about our new mission president, im sure he ll make some changes, but Ive discovered that if youre obedient to your leaders, you love them and life is alot happier.        Im glad that Aurelias recital out at BYU went well.  I didnt really have doubts that she would do well.  Im sorry I forgot to wish Anna and Dad a happy birthday last week, on tuesday I saw the date (the 18th) and just about hit myself.  So happy birthday.  Everybody is getting so old so fast.  I still feel like High school was last year and Im only 19 or something.  Yeah, and my twenty second birthday is coming up in june...       Its good to hear that Charles respects traditions that go back as far as the history of cars goes; breaking tools is pretty much and Andrews family mechanics ritual by now.  So Charles met some people in the singles ward that never have driven a car?  Were they Amish?  I hope you all have a great week, I love you all and keep you in my prayers.        Love Elder Andrews

Aparently I forgot to say a few things about my companion, Elder Pimentel.  First of all, Hes perfect.  Second, hes perfect.  I really enjoy working with someone who loves people and teaches and follows the spirit.  He dosnt speaky engleesh yet, Im going to start teaching him this week as we get more effective with time management- weve had to clean alot of things still.  I appreciate Dad finishing up my taxes, I hope it wasnt too much of a hassle.        Our area is pretty big and one of the things were always told to do is contact our investigators daily, but we have three neighborhoods and we can really only work one day per neighborhood, so were working on contacting as many people as possible per day, use the members and give short, superpowered messages to everyone.  Well see how it works, in theory it should, and E Pimentel thinks it will, so even if it dosnt work, its worth a try.  I believe it will make a difference here.       We had a whole day of service this week and still managed to make our numbers work out in the end.  We are teaching a single woman with three boys who are always giving her trouble, who started to read the Book of Mormon and everything got quiet and peaceful and it spooked her out, so she ran outside to the street to try to hear raquet and disturbance.  She said it reminded her of parts in movies when somebody dies and everythings perfect and peacfull.  I think she thought she might die or something.  We all had a good laugh about that and told her how the Holy Ghost works in our lives.       I hope everything continues well with you all and I pray for you always.          Love Elder Andrews

We are working hard and are trying everything to help our investigators and be effective as possible.  I feel myself growing every day and look forward to studying and sharing what Ive learned with Elder Pimentel.  I love to feel the spirit as we teach those who are eager to hear the message of the restoration.  Ive been trying to read and study the messages I find in the Book of Mormon and share these things with the people we teach, leaving passages that are fresh in my mind with them and helping them understand.  There is a scripture in 1nefi ten, verse 17 that says a few interresting things; e aconteceu que eu nefi, depois de ouvir {as palavras de meu pai que disse PELO ESPIRITO que ele recebeu PELA FE que ele teve no Filho de Deus, desejei ver e saber estas coisas, que podem ser dadas para qualquer homem que procura diligentemente.}  This time as I read the Book of Mormon, Im seeing very apparently the power and importance of faith, both for us and for our investigators.  First, We need to have faith so as to speak with the power of the spirit, which will then help the investigator have a desire to know, even to the extent that they are willing to act in faith, reading hte Book of Mormon for themselves and praying to know the same things that we know.  How true it is that we cannot convert anyone beyond our own conversion!  It is like it is said in Romans 10:17; So then faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the Word of God.       My companion is great, we love to work together.  I would like to express strong desires to remain companions as long as possible, but I am willing to accept whatever assignment you think necessary.  He is progressing very well, and we work together more or less ridiculously effectivly.       Our area is absolutly perfect in every way.  We are recieving refferals de++++, and are being kept on our toes keeping in contact and helping our investigators effectively, but it feels good to be busy.  Our bishop is eager to help us out and we always have miracle contacts, practically every day.  The other day I was feeling a little down and so I started doing contacts.  I would like to share my testimony that one or the keys to having a good day as a missnionary is found in doing lots of contacts.  I dont know how it works, but it lifts your spirits and things begin to happen when you do all you contacts and maybe a little more every day.  I know it makes a difference.      Yesterday after church a man came into the building who had just been released from prison on friday and had nowhere to go and had been resisting going back to his old lifestyle of stealing cars and had been eating out of trash cans, hadnt bathed in days etc., and was sicerely wanting a new life.  So we taught him about the power of the savior to change our lives and gave him a book of mormon as well as a blessing of strength.  After making arrangements to buy a busride to Brusque (a city forty minutes from here) we took him to one of the sisters houses to get some new clothes, food and a shower.  When I first walked into the relief society room, he was sitting in a chair, his head bowed down, hardly thinking himself worthy to be called human, or worthy of recieving help, but when we left him that afternoon at the sisters house with new clothes, food, a means of obtaining a future as an honest man, he was a man, with hope in his eyes; hope of repentance, of obtaining the human dignity which he had lost, and the light of the gospel of Jesus Christ -helping the fatherless and the widowed- shining in his eyes.  I dont know if I will ever see him again, whether he will find the missionaries in Brusque or what the future holds, but I am humbled by the opportunity given to help him, and I will never forget the experience of seeing a man gain his self respect again.  Afterward I told my companion about the beginning of my favorite book, Les Miserables, how a bishop helped a man doomed to social rejection gain hope, and change his life forever by looking at the condemned and giving him the candlesticks, sacrificing to save him who had only just been caught robbing him.  My Mothers name was Cosette, and was named that because my grand parents were reading Les Miserables when my Grandma was pregnant with My Mom.  I never forget hearing my mother tell me the story of Les Miserables on the front proch of the house.  what the story meant to her, and how we should all try to be the same.       I hope you have a great week and I look forward to seeing you and Sister Dansie tomorrow.

Ever since zine conference last transfer, Ive been thinking about what was said concerning faith, and how when we break a commandment, it is because of a lack of faith.  As I read the Book of Mormon, I see more and more about faith and the power that it has.  Alma counseled his son Helaman to teach the people to resist evey temptation from the devil with their faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, Jacob says that their faith was gained and strengthened in studying the Prophets revelation and the spirit of prophecy, and Mormon says that all good things come from Christ and we lay hold upon every good thing by faith.  Elder Richard G Scott said that as we grow in character, our capacity for excercising faith grows and vice versa.  This gave me a few Ideas about how we grow grace for grace as well as grace to grace.  As we excercise faith we build character, or experience in the past in which we can see evidence of things not seen which are true; we know the Lord helped us before, and he can certainly help us again.  It is all very fascinating, and I am learning the power of praying in faith as well.      Elder Pimentel is working and learning perfectly.  The opportunity to train seems more like a reminder of what we learned in the CTM than training.  He is perfect.  I only hope I dont give reason to think Im a slacker in any way.             Our area is pretty big and one of the things were always told to do is contact our investigators daily, but we have three neighborhoods and we can really only work one day per neighborhood, so were working on contacting as many people as possible per day, use the members and give short, superpowered messages to everyone.

After working our tails off and then some, Elder Pimentel and I managed to nearly double all of our numbers for the week and manage to make forty five contacts in fifteen minutes and arrive home at nine thirty exactly.  It was a good feeling to look at all the work we mamaged to get done despite time consuming organaziational matters, renovating the area book, service projects, divisions with the district leader, etc.  Nearly all of our investigators are progressing and we have an extreme lack of time to fit them all in in a given day, but we are managing and the members are beginning to give us a little help here and there as well.  Yesterday after church a man came into the building who had just been released from prison on friday and had nowhere to go and had been resisting going back to his old lifestyle of stealing cars and had been eating out of trash cans, hadnt bathed in days etc., and was sicerely wanting a new life.

Sounds like Morgan is getting pretty into theatre.  Im glad to see that he is getting a taste for the arts.  I hope he dosnt get so involved that he forgets what is most important like I almost did with the cello.  We FINALLY got done cleaning our apartment, we were seriously thinking of asking the stake presidency to call out a ''Maos que ajudam'' service project or calling a bio hazard agency to come over in space suits and clean up the ''twenty-three-nineteen'' situation in our kitchen.  Well Im out of time, so I go ahead and finish up.  I love you all and hope this week is as good for you as mine was.  Boa semana para voces.         Love,                 Elder Andrews

Looks like we got lucky.  This week was ridiculously good numbers wise, but at the end of the week, my companion and I felt like we were blessed and just slacked the rest of the time.  Although this isnt true, we felt like we could have done better.  Friday through sunday I felt somthing weighing me down, like we needed to help someone in particular, but I couldnt figure out who it was, but at eight forty five last night we decided to visit a sister in the ward who signed a divorce this week.  One of the member families that we visit alot(or by way of interpretation, we pass by, talk and get a ride from the brother and teach lessons with him), has been telling us we need to visit this sister, but we put it off until yesterday.  We both agree that she was the one in need of a visit.  I brought my guitar(I got sick of life without music, so I bought a guitar three weeks ago and have been teaching my self in my free time.  Its fun to sing primary songs with it.) and sang two songs; How could the father tell the world of love and tenderness; and that one about a seed in spring which relates to the resurrection and resoration- I like that one because of the chord progressions and diminished minor chords.  Then we gave her a blessing.  I think we helped her alot, shes been pretty depressed.  It was good to use my talents to help someone again.  My companion has the gift of the gab, and much of what I have to say is lost in translation, so sometimes I feel like a third wheel, so again, it felt good to use my talents.       We went on what might be called a wild goose chase on saturday to find a reference a member gave us way out in the country.  All we know is the referrals name is Paulo and he drives a black mercedes.  So basically we looked for the biggest and gawdiest houses and walked upwards of ten miles in five hours, but we made progress in finding the road to the house we all think this paulo lives in.  We ll see next we go out that way.  We had already accumulated our numbers for our goals so we felt alright burning a little time.  It was good excercise too.        Something I feel in regards to Isaiah is that it is more or less the same as revelations.  Joseph Smith said that revelations is one of the most easiest to understand and plainest books in the bible.  Basically the message is this; Were going to win.  I feel the sme way about Isaiah.  If you look at the big picture, its easy to understand, especially if you read it together with Kings.  It tells the promises to Israel and the message is this; Israel is the people of the Lord, and he will remember them.  They will win.  One might suppose that the jews, looking way beyond the point and into the miniscule details, were given things like Isaiah, which are plain, and yet difficult to understand at the same time.  Sometimes you have to back up from the tree so you can see the forest.  Thats the way I look at anything written by Paul as well.  You have to read it all to understand anything.  And now Im rambling.  By the way, I really thought brother Geurnseys commentary in the mob letter about the center of the galaxy was extremely interresting.       Thank you all for the help you give and have aready given me to be on a mission.  I pray for you and hope the family remains strong.  Every things hot and steamy still down on this side of the planet.  Were probably all dreaming about trading places by now.  I cant wait for the cool again.             Love                      Elder Andrews

In Alma thirty one, it says that Alma was granted the answers to his prayer, ''because he prayed in faith''.  I hvae started to notice how our converts need to devolop habits of prayer, not just personally, but as a family.  The same could very easily be said about scripture study and family home evening.  These things stuck out to me, very clearly in what PResident Monson said in the leadership meeting last week as well.  It also says this in the beginning of the planners we use.  I am fast discovering how sweet it is to pray for other people, especially as we visit them.  As I do so, I recieve more charity for them and I pray more for each of them in my personal prayers as well.  Elder Bednar said in his article in the september Ensign, that if feed a man a fish, you feed him for a meal.  If you teach a man to fish however, you feed him for a life time.  Last week I went on divisions with a member of the bishopric, and he pointed out houses of inactive members in almost every street.  I felt to wonder, How would the missionaries who taught them feel if they new these converts were inactive?  What would they do better to insure activity in their converts as they taught if they could see the future?  I will try to teach people to carry the aspects of religion into their personal lives as best I can.       Elder Schioser is dissapointed in being moved, but I always remain puzzled at his reasons for liking the area.  It never has to do with the ward, or the investigators.  Alot of missionaries say they are making a sacrifice of their lives for two years of their lives, when it really isnt much of a sacrifice if you think of the glory of coming home having learned a new language, gone to do the Lords work and returning home as a hero etc.  Its a freeby really, because noone in your home ward was there to see if you slacked off your whole mission or something, but if you give up your whole soul to God, and waste yourself away doing his work, come rain or shine, conveniences of laundry or just having a bucket etc, you have really sacrificed the only thing that is truly yours; your will of action and heart.  Of all things that I would wish to see in the hearts of the missionaries around me is charity.  Many preach, seek baptisms, and tell people the way, but I have seen few who get on their knees and pray with the investigators with the energy of soul with which Alma prayed.  The Book of Mormon is a record of answered prayers of the prophets and even a manifestation of the Lords responses to prayers of faith.  I love the Gospel, I love the restoration, and I love my brothers and sisters here on the Earth.       Our area is doing well, though we ought to get back to work on finding new investigators and marking baptisms, those numbers have been fallin a little for us lately.  The members are the greatest, and I thank you for letting me stay here a little longer.  Yesterday it was hot enough to compete with a volcano.  I was sure to use alot of sunscreen and leave the umbrella in the apartment, and sure enough it rained... HARD.  We had three of the deacons in our ward with us, and it was really surprisingly fun to run like wild through the rain from soffet to soffet, until we stopped and heard a voice ask voces querem entrar?  A woman let us into her small entry to escape from the rain and lightning, and though we were entirely soaked, we talked to her about the gospel and set up a very promising appointment for thursday to come over and teach her about the restoration.  Others might get a little down about getting wet and all, but it lets you know youre alive and its good to get a good laugh in every once in a while as you run without an umbrella in the rain.  It seems like the Lord blesses me with miracles most when it rains.  Ou numbers this week are;Bapt/conf0/0marked baptisms9/3(as I said, I am going to try to work on that one)Investigators in sac. meeting7lessons with members15other lessons20progressing invest.s6referrals0/4new investigators32new members12remember this;77%qualify for the spirit 5 days THank you for all you do and have a good week.

We all went down to transfers conference in Florianopolis on wednesday and I got to see some faces I havnt seen for a while, so I loved it.  My new companion is Elder Pimentel, straight out of the MTC.  As far as training him goes, all I have to do is sit back and enjoy the ride.  Hes better than half the zone leaders and experienced missionaries and then some!  It feels kind of like a breath of fresh air after six months of stagnation.  I am starting to realize how the effectiveness of our contacts in the street effect our enthusiasm when we do them as we should.  I am enjoying being a senior companion as well, it gives me alot more capacity to follow the spirit as I work and teach.  Today we mounted that which previously has been thought of as just an impossible dream;  we cleaned our apartment.  The origianal plan was to start at ten and end at four in the afternoon, but instead we started at seven this morning and had to stop at four in the afternoon.  I like the way brazilian houses are made;  tile and plaster over brick.  To clean, you jsut get buckets of water and scrub everything, so there is no frustration with vacuuming and everything smells like eucaliptus flavored disinfectant afterwards.  I am more or less exsaustified now, so I feel good and will feel even better to come home tonight to the smell of eucaliptus and dream about scrubing stoves that havnt been cleaned since 1992...  B.C.        I still remember singing with Daniel and Paul Woodbury last november and loving it, so I hope Charles had a good time singing with them.  Sounds as if everybody is congregating back at home, so give everybody a big hug for me- if they are still there.  As I said last week, our bishop works in the drug busting department of the police, so we planned a welcome for E Pimentel.  I gave the spare key to our apartment to the bishop and he put an ice box filled with liver in our refridgerator while we were gone and at ten that night we got a knock on the door from the police saying that they had recieved a tip that there was an american ''missionary'' smuggling and selling human organs, so they asked if they could check out our house.  Upon finding the liver in the refidgerator, we were arrested.  My companion stayed calm and cool, but you should have seen his face when the one of the cops introduced himself as our bishop.  I cant think of a better way to meet the bishop of your new area.  Weve been working our tails off and had to ''jog'' to get home on time one night after teaching an amazing lesson.  My companion teaches by the spirit, something my last companions have lacked, and I love to teach with him.         I hope all is well at home and that you are all happy.  Our telephone has a voice memo that can be used for a ringing tone, so every morning as an alarm I now hear ''ver meine spieres spitze, fuertchet, duerschritze das fuer nie!''  (last line in the opera, das walkerie).  Im sure you all miss hearing me belt out opera at the top of my lungs when Im happy...                     Love, Elder Andrews

Aparently I forgot to say a few things about my companion, Elder Pimentel.  First of all, Hes perfect.  Second, hes perfect.  I really enjoy working with someone who loves people and teaches and follows the spirit.  He dosnt speaky engleesh yet, Im going to start teaching him this week as we get more effective with time management- weve had to clean alot of things still.  I appreciate Dad finishing up my taxes, I hope it wasnt too much of a hassle.        Our area is pretty big and one of the things were always told to do is contact our investigators daily, but we have three neighborhoods and we can really only work one day per neighborhood, so were working on contacting as many people as possible per day, use the members and give short, superpowered messages to everyone.  Well see how it works, in theory it should, and E Pimentel thinks it will, so even if it dosnt work, its worth a try.  I believe it will make a difference here.       We had a whole day of service this week and still managed to make our numbers work out in the end.  We are teaching a single woman with three boys who are always giving her trouble, who started to read the Book of Mormon and everything got quiet and peaceful and it spooked her out, so she ran outside to the street to try to hear raquet and disturbance.  She said it reminded her of parts in movies when somebody dies and everythings perfect and peacfull.  I think she thought she might die or something.  We all had a good laugh about that and told her how the Holy Ghost works in our lives.       I hope everything continues well with you all and I pray for you always.          Love Elder Andrews

I dont particularly like messing with them because they cant take care of themselves alot fo the time, but they do make things somewhat more convenient.         Yesterday it was hot enough to compete with a volcano.  I was sure to use alot of sunscreen, and sure enough it rained... HARD.  We had three of the deacons in our ward with us, and it was really surprisingly fun to run like wild through the rain from soffet to soffet, until we stopped and heard a voice ask voces querem entrar?( do you want to come in?).  A woman let us into her small entry to escape from the rain and lightning, and though we were entirely soaked, we talked to her about the gospel and set up a very promising appointment for thursday to come over and teach her about the restoration.  Others might get a little down about getting wet and all, but it lets you know youre alive and its good to get a good laugh in every once in a while as you run without an umbrella in the rain.       My companion, E Schioser, is being transferred, I dont know where because the place he was supposed to go he dosnt like because no one will wash his clothes and he dosnt like the apartment there etc., so he called up the president and told him he wouldnt go there.  I had no idea anyone had the guts to do that.  Oh well, Im pretty sure well know what happens tonight.  I will be training this transfer, and Im more or less RIDICULOUSLY excited.  I want to try to give the best possible to my precious newbie before he gets put with less than obedient companions in the future.  President Dansie generally puts the newest, freshest and most obedient missionaries with the ones that struggles, so I will prepare my new companion for that.  I have some Ideas about how to get the missionary work here to take off in a boom too, so Im looking forward to the next transfer.  This morning we went over to the bishops house to take pictures in his uniforms for work.  He is the commandante of the tactical unit in the police here, so he showed us how to take corners with a pistol, search someone for weapons, etc.  Elder schioser had a hard time fitting in any of the uniforms, but he succeeded in the end.  I am kind of surprised at the kind of guns the police use(.380 auto), which is pretty weak really.  The FBI has to use ten mm, which is pretty powerfull, when doing drugbusts in the states, and there are alot more drugbusts here.  I ll try to send some photos of that later, theyre kind of funny because were up to our chins in gear, yet were wearing haviana sandals...  very chicy      So Charles has started up as a shoe salesman huh?  I always enjoyed retail sales, because unlike other sales, you pretty much only have to worry about customer retention and making other people happy.  Its fun to get people to trust you and make friends too.  I think Charles is good at that, so he should do well.  I love you all and hope you have an excellent week.                       Love, Elder Andrews

This week I have made a concerted effort to read the Book of Mormon PRAYERFULY, as I found a quote from President Hinckley in PMG 108 (english): ''I promise you without hesitation that if you prayerfully read the Book of Mormon, no matter how many times youve already read it, the Spirit of the Lord will will come into your heart.  You will feel a stronger determination t okeep the commandments and a stronger testimony of the living reaity of the Son of God''.  I took it up and I can say it makes a real difference, especially if youre seaching for the blessings promised in that statement.  Needless to say, ive been including this promise in my teachings to members and investigators alike, and it makes a considerable diference.  Music does too.  This week we had our monthly D-day for the zone here.  Its always very efective and its good to go with someone who isnt stuck in the missionary routines.  My assigned area was in the shopping district of the city, so we found (that means we had to serch for them) maybe fifty houses, almost all of which were empty (the beach is a two minute walk from there) and anyone that we encountered was a determined catholic, so I decided to change things up and instead of asking if we could leave a message, I started asking if I could come in and sing a hymn for them.  That worked so well that I think that is going to be one of my primary aproaches to knocking doors from this time henceforth.      This week Elder Schisoer had problems getting up and didnt want to accept help, so I called the zone leaders.  I dont particularly care for telling on people, so I just got it over with and tried to show an increase of love for him.  He wasnt too pleased for my calling, but as far as outward appearances go, I dont think hes holding it against me.         Our area is doing much better now and things are finally starting to pick up with the work, especially with the members giving references and taking friends to church.  We have a baptism this week -a thirteen year old named Evandro- who was a referral who wanted to get baptized from the beginning.  Im grateful that the Lord is answering my prayers for the area and the for the fire of the work in the hearts of the members.         This week as I was reading in Alma 7 verses 15-17 I decide to take the words of Alma seriously and I decided I believed the testimony he left of the Savior and decided to ''lay aside every sin which taketh you so easily'' and make a covenant to serve the Lord, by taking the sacrament.  I love the Book of mormon and know it is true.  I love to testify of its miraculous power in drawing us nearer to Christ.    our numbers this week are0/012/514303060/10409142needless to say I feel good about last week.

It was hard to get all our numbers, due to inclement weather and other things as well including meetings, but we managed to get alot done.  This week I learned that If it rains hard for four days, it floods.  My feet got more or less drenched, but in the end, the work that we got done was very satisfactory.  During conference on friday you said something that sparked my interest.  You said that perhaps one of the greatest reasons we sin is in a lack of faith in the promised blessings for keeping the commandments.  In the last two general conferences, Elder Scott and Elder Hales have said somethings about character and faith; how when we excercise faith, we build character, and the more character we have, the more capacity we have for excercising faith.  I have often pondered why we dont always feel those spiritual highs which seem so infrequent, when we feel the power of the love of God and feel as if we could do anything in his power if it were necessary.  These experiences seem to be the powerful manifestations, or a taste of what is promised, should we remain faithful, that can give us the faith and strength to continue and endure t othe end.  I see the twelve diciples in 3Nefi 19, when their garments were purified, they were in the presence of the savior, I imagine that they looked back many times with nostalgia on that experience and wished they could be there again.  Our remarkable experiences can serve to strengthen, bear and lift us up out of our problems and even temptation.       Elder Schioser is doing well, sometimes his sarcasm stings a little, but I think he might have come from a backround where you develop tough skin against that so I just learn to brush it aside.  He has been entering some websites to play games while waiting for downloads of fotos from his family.  He still has trouble waking up in the morning, he usually wakes up for a few seconds and sleeps again.  When you were calling him in the mornings, he would get up to talk to you and then go to the bathroom and sleep on the toilet.  I try to help him though.  Hes started to take showers later and begins to study at 8:00, and continue in the morning schedule until ten, when he takes a shower.  I tell him that he is a good missionary and that I love him, and I think it makes a difference in how he treats me and even how he thinks of himself.  Its just hard sometimes to help people to be obedient, but I try to do my best.  I very much dislike telling about others disobedience, and I hope you understand that I have absolutley no desire to make myself seem better than him.  He is my brother and I am his.  Thank you for clarifying to us during conference that if our companion is having problems it is OK to tell you, and that it is our duty.  It helps me feel less bad.        Our area is Great.  Things in general are improving a great deal.  We have begun to eat in more members houses and members are giveing some referrals now and bringing people to church.  Several have family or friends that want to be baptized.  We have a family we are teaching, and the wife cannot read, so her husband reads the Book of Mormon to her.  When she told me that, I think it melted my heart.  I dont know what to say other than it just touches me that they read together, that he has enough love to read to her.  We marked her for baptism this week and yesterday I wanted to ask him to be baptized as well, but he was drunk, so infelizmente, nao deu.  I love our members and this ward.  If possible, Id like to stay here for a while, however, if thats not possible, I understand that the Lord sends us where we need to be.       Yesterday we confirmed a new member and as we stood in the circle to bless him, we all put our right hands on his head and our left hand on the shoulder of the person to our left.  I put my hand on the left shouder and someone stood up and and put my had on the right shoulder of my neighbor before we started.  That made me see a relation to other things and I find I am beginning to understand and treasure the very eternal truths we have in the Temple.  I know that we have prophets today, and that the church of God in its absolute fullness graces the earth today.  Jesus Christ lives, He is our Lord, King and salvation.       Thank you for your help to all of us and I hope you have a good week.Our numbers this week are:1/19/41017753/41510140Remeber this- 68% -we have some work to do thereQualify for the spirit- 6/7

I didnt have to worry about the unreliable means of communication they present.  Generally I like to speak to people face to face and use the sincerity of charisma to solve problems and express feelings.  Text messaging is the worst when communicating about important things.  I liked to use text messaging to send jokes or quotes though.  As far as women and communication goes, I agree with you that it really is one of the great differences between men and women in the need to communicate on a constant basis.  Some one pointed out to me that when we drive, women pay attention to what is in a closer proximity than men and men watch further ahead and let the closer things take care of themselves, because what once was the future will be your present sooner or later depending on your speed.  Hence I think that in a fast moving world like we have today, all the communication materials we have ought to be a benefit to women in general and perhaps something of a curse to men.  After all, one of the reasons men look further ahead is to see what really matters-or is only absolutly essential to be done- and do what is in relation that, leaving everything else to neglect, because in the end, it dosnt really matter.  Id say thats open for comments as Im not really sure its true...        The weather here was awful this week.  It rained cats and dogs, and the drainage systems in Brazil are less than ideal, so we did alot of wading and people dont let you in their houses on rainy days, generally speaking, so I discovered why the Lord decided to bless us by doubling our numbers last week- to make up for this week.  We also had alot of meetings and events to go to and seeing as the city bus system in Itajai is o pior do mundo (translation: bad), we generally waited for an hour for a bus to a neighbor hood across the city.  We had our Zone conference on friday in Joinville, a city an hour north of us, but do to accidents, it being the weekend of carnival, flooding and fallen bridges, it took us four hours to get there and another four hours getting back.  There are alot of missionaries who have been taking advantage of the trust which president Dansie gives us and have been breaking rules, so we all got burned.  I love our president because even though hes chastening you, you can still feel his love and how much he means it when he calls us ''the great and noble ones''.  It was a good conference.  We also had a baptism on friday, which we missed due to slow travel time on the way back from conference, but we are happy to see the results of our work.       I hope you all have a great week, I pray for you and hope you are all well.       Love, Elder AndrewsPs- Anna, Ill send a letter to you before your birthday.  I miss you too.PPs- congrats to Woya for breaking a string.  What was she playing this time?  Last time it was Worthy is the Lamb by Handel I think.  Big A major chord if Im not mistaken.

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Querido FamiliaFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@sprintmail.com; skipandrews@att.netDate: Mon, 28 Jan 2008 15:48:55 +0000Dear Family,       sounds like its been an interresting week for you all, and yes, I am a little jealous of the comfortable weather, but I can survive the inferno because I just bought a sun repellant alluminium foil tie that reflects the sun AND the heat...  Not really, because that would be something of a ripoff and I flatter myself that Im not that stupid.  This week we had our monthly D-day for the zone here-when we get all the missionaries in our zone together and work in one area doing divisions with the members and just find people for six hours.  Its always very efective and its good to go with someone who isnt stuck in the missionary routines.  My assigned area was in the shopping district of the city, so we found (that means we had to serch for them) maybe fifty houses, almost all of which were empty (the beach is a two minute walk from there) and anyone that we encountered was a determined catholic, so I decided to change things up and instead of asking if we could leave a message, I started asking if I could come in and sing a hymn for them.  That worked so well that I think that is going to be my primary aproach to knocking doors from this time henceforth.       Im glad that Dad got the opportunity to go out with the missionaries and speak spanish again.  This week we ate lunch with a sister from Uruguay, and I think half of the time she was really speaking spanish.  Its funny how they roll the Rs so much and the Ss in between vowels make a sssss sound instead of the zzzz sound we use in portuguese( casa or house would be and cassa in espnl, and caza in port. ).  It kind of sounds like a lisp.  I think Ill try to learn spanish when I get back and be made fun of for my protuguese accent.       The missionary work here in Itajai has finally started to take off.  Ive been praying alot for it, not just for us, but for everyone in the ward.  We will be having a baptism this week and another in a couple more weeks.  If you could see my face, all you would be able to see is a smile.       Congrats on the DSL, the family will finally be on the internet fast track and you wont have to wait for an eternity for downloads.  Hopefully this letter will make it into your acount, if not im sending it to the old adress as well.  I hope Morgans glasses are somewhat stylish, if not he could always try out my old pink ones...(just kidding).  The members here get a kick out of my telling them that I have pink glasses, and think Im joking.  What I would do for some pictures of me with long hair and pink glasses.  Speaking of which, is it possible to send me some pictures of the family via email or snailmail?  Brazilians love looking at pictures, its almost like an acient ceremony or somehting here.  People treat you like a real person if theyve seen your pictures.  Its kind of funny.       As far as dating for Dad goes, theres a new member in our ward who is divorced(her husband left her) who since finding out that Dad is single wont leave me alone about it.  I dont know if Ill ever stop regretting mentioning it to her.         We got a call this morning from the ZLs that President Hinckley passed away last night.  Im sad that he is gone and am gratefull to him for the excellent work which he presided over and I know he really was a Prophet, Seer and Revelator, just as his predecessors were.  I love you all and wish you a good week.         Love, Elder Andrews

We found several new investigators and are making good progress, especially in the way of getting people to go to church, which is for some reason the very hardest part of what we do.  Alot of people are progressing but never go to church with us.  I guess we arent making as much of a difference in peoples hearts as we need to.  This week Ill be focusing on what I can do to help people to change the desires of their hearts.  Yesterday President Dansie came to our ward for church.  I think he liked it and I feel pleased to say that our chapel was filled to capacity.        I hope Charles is able to get a good job.  It can be tough to find work that you enjoy.  sometimes it seems like IT has find YOU.  Fun stuff.  I was reading in the manual Peach My Gospel this week and decided I need to focus more on the importance of the Restoration of the Gospel through Joseph Smith in my teachings and how it blesses my life and can bless the lives of others as well.  It makes a real diferrence in the way I teach and how people react to it.  So many times it seems that we just leave a VERY short message on a verse of scripture or something that really dosnt help the people in their respective lives, so Im trying to focus on making their lives better any way that I can.  Singing usually helps.  Ive also started reading whole chapters of the Book of Mormon with people to bring the spirit when they read.       I hope you all are well this week and remember that I love you all.             Love Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Elder Andrews Itajai 2From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: MP8-dansiel@myldsmail.netDate: Mon, 14 Jan 2008 13:37:58 +0000Elder AndrewsElder SchioserItajaí IIZona ItajaíDear President Dansie,      This week has gone well enough and I feel like I am starting to help people in gaining testimonies and feeling the spirit.  I really have made a concerted effort to gain more of the spirit as I teach, and to make a stronger effort to pray in faith as it says in PMG chapter 4. I have definately seen a difference in my messages to the members and even in some of our lessons. We represent Christ in peoples homes, so Im trying to live up to that for the benefit of those I serve. Im beginning to learn that while the powers of the enemy are great, the influence of the Holy Ghost and righteousness are greater in their power, especially in creating an environment for keeping the commandments and influencing those we teach to repent and change. As President Eyring put it in conference: ''Our duty, which IS in our power, is to live in such a way that other people will see the fruits of the Holy Ghost in our lives and desire it also, enough to change.''  Or at least thats more or less what he said.  I wouldnt quote me on it but thats the message presented.        My relationship with my companion is alright I suppose.  Sometimes it requires alot of patience but patience has always seemed to pay off, so I trust in the future.  Sometimes he can be very sarcastic and his comments sting, but I can live with it.  Something that I wish could just be buried while we are on the mission is patriotism and politics.  My companion regularly comments on Brazilian supiriority and puts down the US, and while I know that it dosnt really make a difference, it manages to offend and eat up my mind all day, making me angry.  I can get control on my anger, but it takes time, and when provocations are repeated it gets hard to maintain a clean transmission of the spirit.  When people put down my country I feel the same way as if they called my mother something slanderous.  I try to compliment Brazil when asked about it, and I would appreciate a courteous response.  But I can get over it I suppose.  Other things are more important at the present.       Our area is getting better, though its hard to maintain a good standing with the members.  But I love them and want to help them and I hope that they feel it.  I feel things improving as time progresses.  We have a number of good investigators, including José and family, Jose being evangelical based yet skeptical of some of the doctrines in most of the typical churches and very willing to accept the book of mormon.  His wife is catholic and is a little less willing to believe, but I can tell that she feels the spirit when we are there and I think she just needs to have time.  There is also Marcos and Rose, who because Rose dosnt read well are reading the Book of Mormon together.  Our last visit she was excited about what she read about the resurection in 2NE 2.  We also have other excellent investigators, and I enjoy watching people feel the spirit and how it makes them happier.       I was studying in PMG 1 this week and decided to do the activity in the end of the section: The restoration; the foundation of faith.  I said something regarding revelation that I knew was true, and was also more less said by my Três avô when he said in his testimony to his posterity ''I have known all of the presidents of the church except Joseph Smith, and I have seen those that rejected them as prophets fall by the wayside and [perish], while those who sustain the prophets are prospered by the hand of the LORD and are blessed.''  The Church is guided by revelation and those who reject revelation are left behind to stagnate in the empty practices and traditions of men, as were the Jews and all others who rejected the SPOKEN word of God.  I have a testimony that we do in fact have prophets in our days and that they speak with GOD.  GOD lives, and we are his children.  Thats true and I love it.       Our numbers this week are:   0/010/49161860/43711141

This week I have made a concerted effort to read the Book of Mormon PRAYERFULY, as I found a quote from President Hinckley in PMG 108 (english): ''I promise you without hesitation that if you prayerfully read the Book of Mormon, no matter how many times youve already read it, the Spirit of the Lord will will come into your heart.  You will feel a stronger determination t okeep the commandments and a stronger testimony of the living reaity of the Son of God''.  I took it up and I can say it makes a real difference, especially if youre seaching for the blessings promised in that statement.  Needless to say, ive been including this promise in my teachings to members and investigators alike, and it makes a considerable diference.  Music does too.  This week we had our monthly D-day for the zone here.  Its always very efective and its good to go with someone who isnt stuck in the missionary routines.  My assigned area was in the shopping district of the city, so we found (that means we had to serch for them) maybe fifty houses, almost all of which were empty (the beach is a two minute walk from there) and anyone that we encountered was a determined catholic, so I decided to change things up and instead of asking if we could leave a message, I started asking if I could come in and sing a hymn for them.  That worked so well that I think that is going to be one of my primary aproaches to knocking doors from this time henceforth.      This week Elder Schisoer had problems getting up and didnt want to accept help, so I called the zone leaders.  I dont particularly care for telling on people, so I just got it over with and tried to show an increase of love for him.  He wasnt too pleased for my calling, but as far as outward appearances go, I dont think hes holding it against me.         Our area is doing much better now and things are finally starting to pick up with the work, especially with the members giving references and taking friends to church.  We have a baptism this week -a thirteen year old named Evandro- who was a referral who wanted to get baptized from the beginning.  Im grateful that the Lord is answering my prayers for the area and the for the fire of the work in the hearts of the members.         This week as I was reading in Alma 7 verses 15-17 I decide to take the words of Alma seriously and I decided I believed the testimony he left of the Savior and decided to ''lay aside every sin which taketh you so easily'' and make a covenant to serve the Lord, by taking the sacrament.  I love the Book of mormon and know it is true.  I love to testify of its miraculous power in drawing us nearer to Christ.    our numbers this week are0/012/514303060/10409142needless to say I feel good about last week.

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Dear FamilyFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@sprintmail.comDate: Mon, 31 Dec 2007 19:55:15 +0000Dear Family,      I apologize for your not recieving a letter last week, I sent it to Dads earthlink address and it blocked it, so I include last weeks letter at the end of this letter.  This week is transfers and it looks as if no one is moving, much to the disappointment of the members here.  They were hoping that Elder Schioser would be transferred, but hes staying.  They have been complaining to the zone leaders and me about him.  I think he is the reason we havnt eaten in a members house this transfer and while I know that he can be annoying, sarcastic and lacking in social skills, I dont think there is a particular reason to hate him and call him a slacker.  I am kind of disappointed in the members pride and how much it has hindered the missionary work here.  I sometimes feel that there is alot waiting to happen here, but everyone is just waiting for my companion to leave before doing anything and every once in a while I feel like its wasting my short time as a missionary.  Oh well, I guess it dosnt really matter as long as Im doing every thing I can.       Ive been making a strong effort to improve my prayers and have the spirit with me always.  I think its working ever so slowly.  I have also been studying the talk given by President Eyring in Priesthood meeting in october.  It helps me focus on how to be really effective.  Im learning that the greatest powers I can have at my personal disposal are those of personal righteousness and the influence of the Holy Ghost, not just for my personal benefit, but more especially for the benefit of others.  President Dansie had mentioned how when he was a bishop the members always liked to have him around because they felt happy and safe in his presence.  He says the missionaries generally have the same ''aura'', and as I looked over at my companion, I thought to myself: we do??  For a while I just thought that people must imagine this, but as I have made a concerted effort to recognize it, I realize that we do indeed carry a spirit with us, but it depends in strength upon our personal worthiness.  I have been trying to have that spirit in my persona and influence my companion to do better just through example and a little more communication and I think its working more or less.       Sorry to rattle on... this week has been well enough, it was still hot, but oh well, what can one do more than sweat alot?  I finally broke down and bought a liter of Ice cream for six reais, which equates to-way overpriced-, but it was good.  Thats the second time Ive had icecream in the field.  Ive really missed it.       Christmas was fun, we ate lunch at the stake presidents house which was by far the most fancy house Ive yet seen in Brasil; it had wood floors, two stories, a swimming pool, well furnished and real silver ware.  Here in Brasil we would call it -shique demais- or by way of translation, ridiculously fancy.       Other than that, there is not a whole lot to tell about this week, so Ill just wish you all a happy new year and know that I love you all very much.                 Love Elder Andrews  (December 24)I look forward to talking to ya ll tomorrow, its been a while. This week we had our christmas conference with the zones from itajai joinville and joinville north. It was really wonderfull and President Dansie gave a presentation on Joseph Smith (thats been one of our study focusses this transfer) and I got to sing A poor wayfaring man of grief and praise to the man for him. It was really well put together and had a very sweet spirit. then we had a white elephant game. I gave away a multi proposito trocinho para os missionarios(multi purpose dudeamafargin for missionaries[a teeny weirdly shaped pocket knife]) with an instruction manual in english and portuguese. It was pretty funny and one of the assistants got it. I got some REALLY cheap candy and a santa hat. it was still fun to play the game though.I remember when I interviewed with farmers ins. and they gave a ''were sorry but we cant accept you'' letter three and a half months later when I had already gotten another job. I laughed that they felt it was necessary to still send it so late after the fact. Personally I thought it was a joke!Its pretty cool that both Charles and Ben have gotten their degrees! Parabens!well I am running out of time so I have to cut the letter short, but I feel it appropriate to add that .....Im dreaming of a white christmas...today it was over 100 degrees. It just dosnt seem like christmas.Love, Elder AndrewsPS. Hey Charles this is your favorate twenty-one year old brother. merry christmas to you too. ;-D

I really have made a concerted effort to gain more of the spirit as I teach, and to make a stronger effort to pray in faith as it says in PMG chapter 4.  I have definately seen a difference in my messages to the members and even in some of our lessons.

As President Eyring put it in conference: ''Our duty, which IS in our power, is to live in such a way that when we teach, the Holy Ghost will carry our words to the hearts of those we teach and that they will see the fruits of the spirit in our lives and want to change.''  Or at least thats more or less what he said.        Things with my companion could definately be going better.  I try to be encouraging.  Many times I do not understand what he says and ask for an explanation or I miss a key word in a given phrase and he gets mad that Im not listening, but I dont like to ask for explanations because of his sarcastic answers.  Quite frankly it hurts my feelings.  This week we went to a members house who lives forty minutes from our house by foot the night before transfers to teach a lesson to her and her relatives who were visiting.  Elder Schioser wanted to stay and play a video game with her sons.  At more or less nine o clock I asked of we could leave and he asked the irmã if she could give us a ride, but she said she couldnt until later because she hadnt registered her license plate yet, so she would have to wait until there were less police on the street.  So Elder Schioser said that we could wait until nine thirty to leave and sat down to play video games again.  Her family was also making a churrasco which was ready at 9 pm.  So we ate as fast as we could we managed to leave though I felt a little guilty about robbing the guests of their hosts.  Meanwhile there were four elders waiting outside of our apartment since 8 pm and so the zone leaders called which call he decided not to answer.  A few minutes later we got a call from the Assistents.  When we got home at 9:40 ELder schioser walked right past the other elders and hurried to the apartment to get a DVD we had rented to watch for Pday that needed to be returned that night and after apologizing to the other elders and getting one of their bags, I followed him.  He was mad at me for not wanting to return the movie.  so we exchanged a few warm words.  Suffice it to say, I very much dislike it when missionaries want to play video games, and as I am told by the members, they dislike it too.  I wish missionaries would just be obedient to the rules, for their sakes and for the works sake.  The members in my area dont trust my companion and the results of it practically kill the effectivness of the work.  But Im ready to do what I can, after all, the influence of the Holy Ghost and of righteousness are greatest in their power.  Ill find a way with the help of the Lord.     Im sorry to say so much that is negative, and I apologize if it seems that Im complaining, I always look for the best in people so its easier to live with them.  Im grateful for the opportunities Ive been given to grow, I think I needed them.  Our area is good and as I get to know it I love it.  The members are very good and we have some perfect investigators.       I look forward to interviews and hope that you and Sister Dansie are doing well and feel the comfort and strength found in the spirit.  As a mision, we trust you and feel confident in your capacities to lead.  THank you for every thing you do.  OUr numbers this week are:0012/571612737216146

This week passed well, we had interviews with the president, which as a junior companion Ive learned is almost like a tattle tale session.  Sometimes I wish people would just be honest so that I dont have to tell the truth for them.  Whats more is that I wish people would just follow the rules.  But it was good to listen to training from the president and zone leaders.      Our members have put their complaints in the air about problems with the missionaries in the past and so Im going to have to work hard to maintain a trust between us, because my companion thinks every thing is just dandy.  Im not going to tell the details, but suffice it to say that I have to take the reigns on relations with other people and communication with the members.  My companion can be very open about his less than favorable feelings towards me, but I just suck it up and help him and be compassionate.  Its starting to open him up, so maybe I can help him be a happier person...       The other day my companion got hit by a drunk guy on a bike who jumped the curb.  I feel sorry for the biker;  my companion has enough body mass to compete with a small whale.  He always tells me hes not worried about crossing the busy highway because if one of the semis hits him it would destroy the truck, not him.         I got Ruth and Bryants letter this week and have a reply coming to them this week.  Thanks for the picture.  Brazilians love to see photos.  If at all possible I would REALLY appreciate a picture of the family;  I forgot to get a copy before I left and people are always wanting to see a picture of a family of eleven.  Any other pictures are good too.        Good luck with singles ward to Charles, I hear its a little different these days.  I also would like to know, if at all possible, the candidates and opinions etc.  Ill be focusing on the mission of course but I would like to send an absentee ballot if possible.  That and its interesting to see whats going on.  I remember a freind of mine (who is rather liberal) saying she coundnt decide who she would rather vote for if the chance came along: Hilary Clinton, Barrack Obama or Mitt Romney.  I chewed her ear off for putting up values and interrests in the air for what would be cool.  A woman for president, because she(my friend) is blatantly feminist; a Black man for president for black rights and a marker against racsism; and a mormon for president because that would be neat.  And what do they have in common? ..........       Enough on politics.  I can get rather heated in my opinions, like most young people.  Brazil is as hot as ever, I dont know about Aphganistan, but I hope Noahs doing alright there.  I hear it gets hot there too.  We have an investigator who is from Iran and he taught me to write my name in persian.  Suffice it to say that it looks cool.        I hope you all have a good week and nothing I write is less than prudent, most of my communication skills are manifest in face to face relations and lost in txt messaging and emails, even occasioinally on the phone, so I apologize if I ever seem to have a big mouth.  I love you and look forward to hearing from you again next week.      Love Elder Andrews

This week has passed well enough, my companion and I had a brush about keeping rules and paying more attention to other peoples needs.  It was good to get a few things out in the open and fortunately I think we are both trying to improve on what the other requested.  It seems that sometimes there are things that lie under the surface that need to be said in order for your working together to work better.       One of our investigators FINALLY went to church this week.  We went for six weeks here passing by peoples houses in a van to take them to church and none of them came, so this was more or less a big event.  I felt like baking a cake and inviting the ward over for a celebration or something.  I feel as if the area is finally taking a turn forthe better at last; I just hope we can keep it up.        Im glad Morgan is dancing at the dances instead of just hanging out.  Now if he would just go to louis and co on saturday nights, he could become the swing king and win all the hearts of the stake young women.  I remember when was fourteen I decided to stay home and read the third Harry Potter book.  Everyone thought I was afraid t of the dance, and made fun of me, but I really wanted to finish the book.  Im glad Im not a teenager any more and all my troubles are over...        I want you all to know that I love you and I pray for each of you often.  I keep Noah in my prayers as well and hope he is safe in his tour of duty.  Boa sorte nesta semana e bom ano novo para voces!       Love Elder Andrews.   P.S. Thanks for passing the message from Gabby, Charles.  I really miss every one at the dance studio.

This week we had our christmas conference with the zones from itajai joinville and joinville north.  It was really wonderfull and President Dansie gave a presentation on Joseph Smith (thats been one of our study focusses this transfer) and I got to sing A poor wayfaring man of grief and praise to the man for him.  It was really well put together and had a very sweet spirit.  then we had a white elephant game.  I gave away a multi proposito trocinho para os missionarios(multi purpose dudeamafargin for missionaries[a teeny weirdly shaped pocket knife]) with an instruction manual in english and portuguese.  It was pretty funny and one of the assistants got it.  I got some REALLY cheap candy and a santa hat.  it was still fun to play the game though.       I remember when I interviewed with farmers ins. and they gave a ''were sorry but we cant accept you'' letter three and a half months later when I had already gotten another job.  I laughed that they felt it was necessary to still send it so late after the fact.  Personally I thought it was a joke!      Its pretty cool that both Charles and Ben have gotten their degrees!  Parabens!        well I am running out of time so I have to cut the letter short, but I feel it appropriate to add that .....Im dreaming of a white christmas...  today it was over 100 degrees.  It just dosnt seem like christmas.              Love, Elder AndrewsPS.  Hey Charles this is your favorate twenty-one year old brother.  merry christmas to you too.  ;-D

This week we were invited to an investigators house to have churrasco (Barbacue) with his two brothers and their families.  It was fun, but in the middle of the lesson we got a call from the mission president.  Jose, the investigator, got back from work at eight forty and then prepared the food, so we were out a little late.  President dansie called us at nine forty as we were finishing the lesson to ask me if I would sing a couple of songs in his training at zone conference.  Busted...  No, he just asked if we were out so late all the time, so I got to explain the situation.  That was fun, but we werent in trouble, so thats good.  It just gives me good motivation to keep the rules.        For the phone call on Christmas, the number for the phone we will be using is 011-55-48-9624-6872.  We are four hours ahead of you so at six in the morning it is ten o clock am and at noon there it is four here.  You could probably do the math in your head, but I wanted to test my arithmatic.  Not bad, eh?  You can call whenever you want, well have the phone with us all day, so fique vontade, tudo bem?        The members here seem somewhat closed to us and cold, so I called up Elder Giló, my trainer(the phone call is free because he works in the mission office) to ask him what he thought I could do because he is notorious for setting his areas on fire and getting the members to love him.  He gave me a couple of Ideas, but especially the advice that I could sing for the members in their homes.  That has made a more or less ridiculous difference in just one time, let alone the other opportunities that Ive taken to sing.  If I got a nickel for every time someone asks me about the CD Charles, Aurelia and I made, I would be a quintrillionaire.        I recieved my copy of the November Ensign this week.  Im so happy...  Ive been spending every spare moment reading it and I have to say, President Eyring´s talk during the General Priesthood Meeting is very study-worthy material.         Im sorry to hear that we lost a part of the sycamore tree, I love sycamore.  I miss the cold too, this christmas season dosnt seem like christmas at all because of the heat, but thats ok because nothing seems real right now.  A mission is like a two year bubble separated out of measure of time for me.  Time flies, today Ive been out for seven months.  I hope every body travels safely on their way home from school and other places.  Is Nicole (Woodbury) still planing on serving a mission?  Any ways, Merry Christmas and Talk to y'all next tuesday.            Love, Elder Andrews

This week the family has been in my thoughts alot, especially Mom.  We got our conference editions of the Ensign, which Ive been reading very ravenously as I didnt understand a word of it when it was broadcasted in portuguese.  I liked the article by Julie Beck about mothers who know.  Mom qualified with flying colors on all subjects and you do too, Grandma.  The following days it was impressed on me that my Mom knew and does know, and I remembered the things I learned from her through example.  I saw her pray in the mornings when she got up, I saw and heard her read scriptures and seek revelation to help her raise her children, and even the last day of her life she was trying to fulfill her responsibilities for the Primary.  Thank you for raising you children so well.        These last two days have been more or less difficult to actually teach lessons or even leave messages with people because of the season, so me and my companion resorted to singing carols to our investigators and converts.  We may not have pumpkin pie to give, but we can always try to bless their lives with the spirit.  My companion is completely tone deaf, but we still manage to bring the spirit of the music, which is by far more important.  It kind of reminds me of that ''activity'' we used to do when every body picks their own key to start in and every body starts singing and tries to keep their own key, no matter how bad it sounds.  I know I can win now...       The members treat us well enough though I was informed by our zone leaders this week that my ward in general dislikes my companion, so there is some coldness there, but Im hoping to change that, and it is already slowly changing.  we will be spending christmas at a new member famliys house who like us, so alls well.  Im glad that Uncle Rick is still humble about his cheesecake ''building'' abilities.  Im sure if the missionaries knew the possibilities of deliciousness found at Barbaras and Ricks, they would spend both christmas AND christmas eve at the Putnams.  Their loss.         I love you all and wish you a merry Christmas.  Let me bear testimony that Jesus Christ is our brother and King.  He certainly did leave a path to follow that we can trust and tread, and while He was and is the Son of God, He was just like us in mortality, and -if we will- we can be just like Him in eternity.  He is our Savior, and we can ''behold the condesension of God'' in his birth.                   Love,   Elder Andrews

Ive been focusing on PMG chapter four and reading a great deal in the Ensign conference edition.  Thank you for letting us get it, this conference was perfect, Ive been studying President Eyrings talk in priesthood and it has helped me grow significantly.  My prayers have improved and so has the work which I have done.  Im starting to feel more like an effective missionary again and my confidence is growing.       Elder Schioser is doing well and at least from my view of things we put up with each other rather well.  Our planning sessions make a strong diference in the work we do.  He is the first Brasilian Ive been with who has been a member all his life and I have to say that he knows alot of things and likes to share them.  So thats good.  Were both looking forward to talking to our families on Christmas.       Our area is doing well and I think were finding more and more good investigators, which I might add from what Ive seen this week, which is helped significantly by having members with us to teach and get to know the investigators.  When I arrived here the members here seemed somewhat closed to us and cold, comparing them with Criciúma, so I talked to Elder Giló to ask him what he thought I could do because he is good at getting the members to love him in whatever area he is put in. He gave me a couple of Ideas, but especially the advice that I could sing for the members in their homes. That has made a major difference in just one home, let alone the other opportunities that Ive taken to sing.  Last night we taught a family home evening to four families about the first lesson and how it goes and the simplicity of teaching by testimony, not information.  I want to start seeing the members give more referrals and participate in teaching, and I think comfort and trust are the keys.  I think its working.  During one of my prayers this week I got the distinct impression that the work here in our area is ready to take off, we just need to get the members going and set the fire to the powder.Our numbers this week are as follows:0/013/57171690/32815154Merry Christmas to you and Sister Dansie, well see you at conference!

Congratulations to Charles on the graduation and the solo too.  Id sure be interested to know what hes singing.  Im sure he and Aurelia will be more or less atounding to assembled guests, no matter what they sing.  This week has passed relativley fast, and the events of the week were smooth and after looking at the numbers we achieved, I have to say things happen easier even though it requires the same amount of effort make things happen.  My companion works hard to find people and we are teaching well enough.  Its just hard to stay focused on portuguese during lessons and meetings.       I dont know what it is about this place, but cockroaches live in an abundance, despite my efforts to clean our apartment.  I think the problem extends to all inhabitants of the building we live in as well.  I didnt really see a noticeable number in Criciuma, and I lost count last week, so I might have to look into it.  I think PART of the problem could be found in the fact that I may be the first one to ever clean the bathroom in the last eternity.  I swear I must have used half a bottle of toilet cleaner in one scrubbing.  Members always ask me if President Dansie is coming to apartment when they see me buy toilet cleaner, so I think the issue could be found in all missionary apartments, excepting most of the sisters.  I just have a preference of smell when I enter the Bathroom.       Since I was about twelve, I always took notice that my parents never really held a grudge and were generally calm faced in the front of annoyance.  I try to emulate it, though sometimes its hard.  I dont think I can hold a grudge for more than six hours before forgetting it.  And then if someone buggs me again, I really want to lash out at them and tell them of all their previous offences were, but I dont ever remember what they were, even though I know they happened.  So if any one thinks that I dont fight back, its usually just that I have a horrible memory.  I dont worry so much about what kinds of things I might have done to offend mom as much as the things that I do now, when can see all, that might offend her.  Knowing that a person dosnt hold a grudge is a good thing to me as it allows me to always be comfortable around the said person.  If not, I end up walking on glass trying not to trigger memories on past grudges they may be holding.       Any ways, I hope none of that sounds cocky or selfrighteous.  I appreciate your letters, prayers and love, and you can always remember that I love you and pray for you all as well.  Have a good week.             Love                         Elder Andrews

This week I have focused my studies on Jesus Christ and his mission and my personal relationship with him.  I have also been thinking of what you said in my last interview about not wanting to sin the same way we would not want to hit a child running accross the street.  Some things in our lives can seem like just a weakness, or a challenge that we live with and try to overcome, but they are sins, things that hurt and offend our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ very litterally.  What Ive been learning about motives for repentance is interresting and so far I have discovered three in my life: because youre afraid of punishment, to be clean, and because youre sorry for hurting your beloved Savior and God.  The last is the most lasting in its effects and is a precursor to recieving a chang of heart, which helps us immensly in avoiding sin.  Some times I just wish I could have been there with the apostles during the Savior´s ministry to know him personaly the way come to know our earthly friends, but the challenge of reaching a hand through the veil and developing a personal relationship with the savior through faith can be stronger.  I marked the chapters in Jesus the Christ that were in relation to me and my relationship directly to study during my personal studies.  Its good.      Elder Schisoer is great and always extends invitations for commitments to people.  Its great.  He sure knows alot of things and can bring up anything in a lesson, but he always has a good spirit when he teaches, and especially when he prays.  Im trying to pray more like he does, focusing on what is needed in the present.  Im learning the value of focusing on the present situation and things in relation to it and how that helps me be far more effective.  I enjoy our planning sessions and hope that Elder Schioser trusts me in what I teach.      Our area is good, though I grew up in Kansas and cant say that Ive ever seen a flatter place that Itajaí II.  The people are great and there are many references to contact and teach.  The members a good and generally willing to help us.       This week we taght a lesson to an internet reference who is nammed Cassia.  She studied theology and wanted to know more about the beliefs of the Mormons, so she had asked for a Book of Mormon.  She grew up in the Quadrangular church and so while respectful, she was somewhat skeptical, but after testifying about authority that is needed to oficiate in ordinances and the diferences between the ordinances of the gospel and the principles, she wanted to know.  Ive never seen any one change from being Interested yet distanced by knowledge to an actual desire to know the truth.  And the spirit did it.     our numbers this week are:0/011/510111990122010140/11Boa Semana

So this means that either I have been exceedingly wise in cleaning the bathroom every day, or I have already killed off the brazilian varieties of the insect.  Or it could be my discovery of two nocturnal lizards living in our living room which I have decided to let stay based on the story about uncle Michaels lost lizard.  I wasnt sure who that stary was about anymore(I heard it a long time ago) so I thank Dad for the specifics.      I bought Fantasia 2000 from a street vendor this week so I could hear some tasteful music again and remember what it was like to play that music.  I dont really care about the parts where they talk in between, so I put it on in spanish this morning to see if I could understand it.  Spanish sounds really formal and I dont know... just funny I guess.  To me it sounds just overpronounced portuguese with an extreme accent.  I enjoyed it.  It was good to hear the peices Aurelia so well when she was living at home, especially the Schostakovitch Piano concerto No 2.  Shique de mais.       We had another D-day this week and it was a success, though not nearly as musch as last time.  The Internet place is closing now so I have to go.  I love you all.     Elder Andrews

I had a good Thanksgiving and even though I didn´t get to officially celebrate it, I was able to write in my journal the things that I am most grateful for and feel a spirit of thanksgiving throughout the day.  I have been reading in second Nephi, and on that particular day I read 2NE 4.  I am glad that Nephi was able to follow the spirit in his writing as that particular chapter is a jewel in the Book of Mormon.  I have been enjoying reading the passages in Isaiah as well, even if you can´t understand certain things, or just don´t have the patience to decypher everything, you can still enjoy the spirit of the text and feel the spirit.      Thank you for putting me with Elder Schioser, he does a great job at planning, and though he stuggles getting up in the morning, he is very serious about hte morning schedule, something Elder Fontenele wasn´t so much focused on.  while I am somewhat sad to leave the people in Criciuma, I am very pleased with the opportunity to start anew.  I always enjoy what is said in the trasfer meetings about hope and opportunity.  Its true.  Elder Schioser is either very sincere, or very overtly demonstrative in his prayers and Im inclined to think it is the former.  I look forward to hearing his prayers during the day.  He is a good man.       Our area is good and, much to the satisfaction of my legs, very flat.  The members are open and give us references, two of which have already turned into marked baptisms, Jean and Felipe.  When I told the sister who gave us the referrals, she couldnt believe they were already marked for baptism.  Elder Schioser is also very good at helping the investigators make commitments.       The following paragraph may be included in the group of miracles that Sister Dansie is making:       This past saturday, the Itajaí stake held D-Day, a day when the whole zone gets together in one ward area and does divisions with the members and then- we find people.  I feel it appropriate to say that there is a general comfort zone in the way we as missionaries go about our business and especially in the case of our contacts; most of the time it is just giving a card away, and just that.  The member that I went with, Maurício, has served a mission and was very enthusiastic in talking to people.  We knocked on a few doors with relatively good success and after a few houses, we stopped for a moment, trying what to do next as we had reached the end of the street.  I told Maurício that rather than just leaving a short message, I would rather leave the first lesson in a very short formatting of ten minutes, more or less, so I explained the principles and asked him to be able to share his testimony whenever he wanted during the lessons duration.  Maurício asked to pray.  So we did.  He said the prayer.  He spoke to Heavenly Father of the blessings we had and wanted to find a family, one that was ready.  So we got up and walked down the street until we came to a fork in the road.  One was paved and looked as if it would have a good yield of residents, and the other was a dirt road ascending the hill and looked relativley inhabitantless.  However, I remember one of my most wonderful baptisms was in a similar street, far beyond what seemed likely, so we decided to ascend the hill on via this dusty dirt road.  We came upon a group of four houses hidden in the trees and so we clapped our hands.  For nearly five minutes all that issued from the house was a rather vicious looking dog, but we waited.  A man with one arm and a cast on his leg came out, it looked as though he had walked thirty yards on this cast to get to us and he was calling to the dog.  I couldn´t tell if he was saying ''peggy''  or ''pegue ele''.  But we asked if we could leave a message, even if it had to be outside of the house and so we started with a prayer.  Then we taught the first two principles of the first lesson and Maurício bore his testimony.  The man interrupted and asked if he could come to church as well as his family and also if we could come back and teach his family, all of which occupy the four houses.  Maurício will be taking them to church this comeing sunday and while I do not think that I will ever get the opportunity to return to Blumenau (who knows?), I feel the spirit testify that that Maurício´s humble prayer was answered, and that if he had not been there with the missionaries that day, we would not have found Valdenir.  The Lord guides the work.  Even if we do not baptize the whole world, we can still bring hope to them that sit in darkness, to lift the hands that hang hoplessly down, to love our bretheren and sisters.       Our numbers this week are:0/013/641871061511143/9       Thank you for every thing you do for us.                                   -Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Oi Família!From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@sprintmail.comDate: Mon, 29 Oct 2007 15:38:46 +0000Dear family,       This week went well, we had interviews with President Dansie in Tubarão and it was fun to have the elders from Criciúma 1 and Arangua over for the night to prepare for the bus ride.  Its good to talk to other americans.  I figured that since I didn´t get a letter last week you were probably busy or traveling so naturally I didnt freak out.  We got a call from some elders in Boston informing us that they had a new convert coming down to Criciúma (there are alot of brazilians in Boston) so we went to visit her this week and after I asked a few questions about trees in boston she asked if I had ever been to the states.  I replied that I used to live there and she asked for how long.  She thought I was brazilian!  ISSO!  I was more or less ridiculously pleased.      Tip for the week:  The trees are only turning yellow because the first trees to turn colors are ash trees.  Most neighborhoods in Olathe that are older have pin oak-which will just turn brown later in the season and keep the majority of leaves throughout the winter- and Green ash, which turn yellow.  Newer neighborhoods will be turning Purple fisrt because they plant alot of Autumn purple ash, which are more popular than green ash because they are less suceptable to borers and they are male trees so they do not produce fruit.  In mid to late november, youll be seeing all the katrillions of red maples- esp the red sunset variety which everyone and their dogs fleas buy for their front yard- which I, even myself sold last fall by quite literally thousands.  This is because Maples are naturaly from the north and as such are more accustomed to the  cold.  I tend to prefer red oak and legacy sugar maple myself, which are native to the new england area.  I miss american trees.     I sendmy personal congratulations to Bogrid on his excellent academic achievements.  I´m sure Mikail Ivanovitch would be worried to find his enemy following so well in his footsteps.  Sydney´s soccer program saound fun, I bet she is alot better than I am.  I think people suppose that soccer is just kicking a ball back and forth kind of like they think that boxing is just ''two men standing there hitting each other'', but people stop the ball, dance around it and spin it in different directions etc fake people out etc.  There´s a young man in our ward who is more than proficient at this who I call twinkle toes.  I bet you all enjoyed the Bsass Pro Shop in springfield.  when people watch 'Cars' I always explain what a red-neck is to them.  they like to hear about the guys who catch four foot catfish using their fists as bait...     I hope Grandma Z is doing alright, the members out there in bellefontaine are amazing so we can trust that she is in good hands.    Well I love Ya´ll so have a good week and BEEE GOOOOOOOOD....               Love                 Elder Andrews.         PS.  Its hot

I feel that my studies in the scriptures are more satisfactory as I am shifting my focus from just attaining knowlede to getting to refresh my testimony of the Savior and plan of salvation every day.  It is significantly more edifying to the soul.      I spoke to Elder Fontenele about our numbers this week and we discussed some ways to improve our area and the effectivness of the work, and I think it will make a difference.  Ive decided that it might make it easier for him if I help a little more in decision making and planning, mainly in comunication, that way we are accountable for our work not just to leadership, but to each other.  I think if people feel better about themselves through honesty and obedient work, they feel better about themselves and want to work more.        I love Criciúma and the people here.  They are wonderful people and are getting rather fired up to do missionary work.  The leader of the Rapazes asked us to teach the friends of the young men before they start playing soccer and we got a golden reference out of that.  The said leader was thinking of the rapazes doing a missionary activity talking to people in the praza and helping us out.  Our new ward mission leader is a recent convert and wants to get the whole ward involved and the bishop is trying to focus especially on missionary work in the activities of the ward.  We have alot of references to contact and people that were marked for baptism to renew and refire up in regards to the news of the church.  I have to admit, Its REALLY difficult to get investigators to church.  zero out of our hoped for and invited 13 people came to church.  Alot of them promised to come to chuch next week, so we are going to help them keep their commitments as much as possible.       I had the opportunity to adress the members in a missionary fireside yesterday, and my focus was on the essenciality of faith in missionary work and that missionary work exists in all the three phases of the Plan, that we were given our opportunities and blessings through the gospel because we were among the great missionaries before this life, so we should do all in our power to live up to our past.       I look forward to zone conference and e gostaria de dizer- boa semana para você e the staff!

My compliments to Dad on his perception on transfers.  I am now in the sea port of Itajaí, a few hours north of Florianopolis.  Let me describe my new companion.       Last sunday night after we found out about transfers, my trainer, Elder Giló called to ask if I was excited to be transferred.  I said sure and then I asked if he knew anything about my new companion Elder Schioser.  I wish you could hear Elder Gilos accent- ''Oh ELDER,...  He´s so FAAAT!''  Whenever I told people he would be my companion, they just laughed and gave me the ''look'' as if I were on my way to ...a really bad place.  Elder Schioser snores something terrible.  Apparently my zone leader went on divisions with him one time and couldnt sleep all night.  Lucky for me I am a heavy sleeper.  But I really like Elder Schioser, he does what hes supposed to and it is like a breath of fresh air.  I suppose my only complaint would be that he takes up the whole side walk!  He is my first companion that dosn´t speak any english, so my poertuguese is improving and I find myself quite surprised at how well I speak and understand now.       I hope you all had a happy Thanksgiving, I remembered you and hope that you all know that I love you very much.  We got a fair amount done and I am enjoying my new area though it is really flat and there are no hills to let you know where you are-or if your legs arent strong enough.  I am glad that Charles was able to get back to ID in one piece, sounds like he had some troubles with his car, but he is an andrews, so he´s bound to have car troubles on a road trip.       On Saturday we went to Blumenau to have a D- Day.  Basically the whole zone goes to one ward area and splits with the members, making roughly twenty companionships and we go and find people.  It was VERY effective and I must say that Blumenau (founded by the germans) is something of a gorgeous city.  One of the americans had the nerve to mention pumpkin pie.  All the rest of us walked around for the rest of the day with mouths watering and hearts pining.  Well, I hope all goes well at home and that Morgan and Anna finish the semester well.  I suppose that goes for Charles and Aurelia too.  I´d like to know what time of day will be best to call on Christmas as President Dansie wants us to make all the preparations now.  We´re on daylight savings time right now.  And if you get a chance tell Stephen Harper I am serving in Itajaí and I got to go to Blumenau.  He served more or less in those places.             Love, Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Hello FamilyFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@sprintmail.comDate: Mon, 5 Nov 2007 20:24:00 +0000Dear Family,      this week was well enough, we went to the college again to teach english and a little about the church.  Alot of questions to answer.  I talked to my companion about the state of the area that we´re assigned to cover and we decided to improve some things that needed improving and our comunication, so hopefully our area will progress a little better.      Im really missing the fall right now, especially after what Dad wrote about hot chocolate and cider.  I love the changes in seasons.  The air always seems fresher...  Congratulations to Catherine on the baby!  I really miss all of my neices and nephews, I hope they are all doing well.  Well even if the publishers don´t like Dads book, you can always try to publish it for the family or something for their benefit.  Id be interrrested in reading it when I get back.       I got to give a talk in a missionary fireside yesterday about missionary work.  Surprise, surprise.  I started by talking about the war in heaven, which I dont think was so much a war with swords as much as it was a fight to get others to make the right decisions.  Im sure there were people that were not so sure they could succeed and were thinking of supporting the other plan to insure their success, and we know the enemy is particularly gifted at making us feel lesser than we really are, but there were other stronger people, who said that we could have faith, that no matter the negative consequences, we could hope for salvation through the Savior.  We promised people that we would help them.  Missionary work has existed since before this world, it exists now and exists after this life.  We have the opportunity to serve now, as members of the Church, to fulfill promises and reap the rewards of our earlier missionary work and valiance in this life.       I find it interresting that the only pain or sorrow Heavenly Father feels and can feel is in regards to his childrens unrighteousness and whether they love him or not.  It is not in lost planets or galaxies, but in the loss of his own children.  I feel confident that if it were necessary He would cause whole star systems to evaporate into nothingness to allow us to return to Him.  But instead, He leaves it up to the direction of His Son, and the rest of his hosts children in doing the work before, during and after this life on the earth so that we may grow as a family and return to His presence as His children ready and worthy to inherit the divine stewardship of godhood, having proved ourselves selfless and just, redeemed of the Son.      That was more or less the theme of my talk with a short part about how to turn our faith into action through making goals and commitments.       I hope you all have a good week this week and remember that I love you all.               Love                         Elder Andrews

That was an interresting story.  Happy birthday to Ben by the way, I forgot to say that last week.  This week we had zone conference and I enjoyed it alot.  Also, roughly 90% of our appointments fell through because the city move to the beach during the day and returns at 9:30, or so it seems.  The quality, however, of our lessons that we did teach practically sky rocketed, so that was satisfactory.         Today I have been exceptionally tired and so there is a high possibility of my falling asleep while writing, so if my head falls and rest on the zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz button, youve been warned...  Ive been focusing more on the aspects of helping people and lifting their hearts a little mor this week because there wasnt alot to do in regards to meeting people so its best to focus on quality when quantity is not achievable, right?        After church this sunday a member gave us -and some other people-- a ride to lunch.  I didnt think eight people could fit in a Volkswagen Golf, but I was wrong.  And when they wanted to put Diego, six foot tall and all arms and legs, in the back with us, everyone consented that it was too much.  the member that gave us a ride told us about his puppy that fell from the deck of his house on a chain and leash.  He says it died, so he performed mouth to mouth recsusitation...  It lives...  The things people do for their Dogs...  Its funny to see an eight year old running in the isles during sacrament meeting during the prayer and trying to run while praying with his eyes closed.  I think you all can use your imagination as to what happens in such cases.  Im just glad I was taught to be reverent in church.  Any how, those are some things that rather tickled me this week, so I hope you all enjoy them too.         I love you all and thank you all for the sacrifices youve made for me and hope all goes well for you.                     Love                                Elder Andrews

We were invited to go to an english class at the local college so the students could hear a native speaker.  It was pretty fun and I got to teach the entire first lesson to twenty seven people.  We gave out cards to recieve the Book of Mormon to all the students, so I think we might get a few lessons out of that.  We also went to the youth activity to teach the young men´s friends who play soccer with them the first lesson and three of them asked for Books of Mormon and wanted to learn more.  We taught one of the young men and his family yesterday and they were pretty cool about it and very open to what we had to say.      My companion has been doing well healthwise this week and we got to make our way out to some other barrios, so I think we will get to pick up the pace a little more if we can work on commitments.      Our numbers this week are:0010/1237381/0364140/6

Dansie     Its been an ok week, though I feel I could have done significantly better.  Ive been thinking and suppose that I can always do better and if there are things out of my personal control to accomplish, I can at least do the best I possibly can to accomplish and magnify the things that are under my control, so I have made some goals for this week that I hope make a difference in my mission.      Since I am going to be with Elder Fontenele for another transfer, Ive decided to resolve any problems I have with him and try to be easier to work with.  I wouldn´t be the first person to say we have a natural chemistry, but with a little work, we can be a good team, it just requires work that has heretofore been dormant.       our area is well, the members still give us references and we have about twenty referencias de internet to contact which is good.  I love Criciúma and all the members here.

I got an email from Paul Paul that I thought was from Uncle Paul until he said he was getting ready to serve a mission and I did a double take.  It was pretty funny.  Ill probably write a reply snail mail next week.  The pouch service is no longer available, people probably sent too many photos or things that you should only send through regular mail.  So if any if you want to send mail, go ahead and send it to the mission adress.      Sorry Aurelia is having such a hard time, Im kindof glad I dont have to worry about cars and money for while yet, its very nice.  A family we baptized a month or so ago ismoving to São Paulo to work, get passports and move to spain.  They invited Elder Gilo and I to go visit them after the mission.  theyre remarkably strong in hard times, because Marco, the father worked in portugal for a long time and saved ALOT of money and moved back here to live.  He lent out about 100,000 reais and helped out some people and had hired a lawer to get him a passport and tickets to spain, but the lawer took off with all six thousand reais and now the family is living in a house the size of my room back home.  But theyre still fine and optomistic.  Theres not really a whole lot else to tell this week so I guess Ill go ahead and finish up.       I love you all and hope this week is better for everyone.      love             Elder Andrews-----Original Message-----From: skipandrews &lt;skipandrews@sprintmail.com&gt;To: Joseph Andrews &lt;jakaal@myldsmail.net&gt;Date: Mon, 15 Oct 2007 07:57:07 -0500Subject: letter  October 14, 2007Dear Joseph:I suppose that most missionaries end up having to cope with a companionthat is not always a hard worker. For lack of a better example you mightrecall elder Calhoun and elder VanPelt from the best two years. Theirapproach to dealing with companions was quite different and you wold bebest off if you didn’t take the confrontational approach. Some times wejust have to kind of o with the flow and do the best that we can.The other thing that you should understand is that having a companion ispreparation for having a wife. Once you are married to someone who isimperfect as you will also be it is important to deal with thesituations that arise in a way that will be as constructive as possible.If you approach things in the wrong way you may just make them worse.Learn now so that you will be more prepared for marriage when it does come.We have had weather in the sixties and seventies this week and it hasbeen beautiful weather except Monday and Saturday when it rained. It hasbeen in the forties and fifties at night and kind of nippy in the earlymornings. We really did need the rain so I was happy to have it.This week has been a lousy week for me. I have lacked animation as wellas motivation. Nothing seems to have gone real well and just not funthough nothing great has gone wrong.I think Aurelia has had the same kind of week maybe. I’m not really surehow all here week went. She called earlier this week and bent my ear fora while. She said she hated living with girls. They got a new roommatethat is immature and was unhappy and wanted to change roommates. Wellthey got together and had a talk session in which everyone said all thewrong things. And now everyone hates everyone else’s guts. She went outto her car and it ran out of gas before she got out of the parking lot,which is a lucky thing. However she was going to have to ask one of herroommates to take her to the gas station and she knew that that wouldonly irritate them more. She is also low on funds till she gets her nextpay check. She was on her way to the testing center to take a quiz whenshe called and got to the center before she was any where near done. Shesat on a bench by the doors and finished talking. After the quiz a youngman, a freshman, approached her and said that he had overheard her phoneconversation about her desperate straights and asked if he could takeher to get gas. She accepted and he did. He also put twenty dollarsworth of gas in her car. The young man commutes to school every day fromTaylorsville, Utah. At any rate she was a little shocked and also glad.I told her tho thank the Lord for the young mans kindness when she saidher prayers.Charles called one night this week and said he had participated in arelay of some kind each person ran around the track once and I have noidea as to ow many people were involved but he said that he broke sixtyseconds for his lap. He was pleased to have done so well.Ben and I tore the probe apart this week. There was a problem with thedrivers side front tire. We had to take the lower control arm off and inthe process we had to cut the stabilizer link off. It was a little bitof a hassle but we eventually got it off. One of the bushings was wornout and casing the tire to wear badly. The front end couldn’t be alignedtill we fixed it. We ordered parts but they won’t be here till Tomorrow.Ben also ordered a new tire which we picked up. I got the ball jointreplaced on the arm so we just have to wait for parts.Well that is most of the news from here again.LoveDad

This week temptations have been hard to resist.  Im going to evaluate what I can do to be stronger and more effective during my scripture study tomorrow.       Elder Fontenele is doing well.  He tends to be quasi sickly sometimes, and the medication he takes makes him drowsy so I need to keep myself focused to help him.  Most people really only need another voice to confirm the right choices in their hearts, so Ill try to be a good support there.  I have a feeling that Elder Fontenele is really quite similar to me in many ways and I can use this opportnity to grow my weaker sides in preparation for other things in life and in decision making processes.      Our ward is excellent, the members give us referrals and the new converts help us out immensly.

He sleeps in alot likes to return to the apartment to kill time or take a nap.  Alot of the times I have desires to go to other neighborhoods to work instead of going back to the apartment but I don´t want to be a controlling companion, so if you have any advice it would be VERY appreciated.  I didn´t think that it was particularly appropriate to mention it in the letter so im sending this to you and any one else you think could help out.  I was hoping to just wait out the transfer till I would get to show around a new elder in another companionship here, but that s not happening.  I love you Dad and appreciate the things youve done to help me get out here.  Sorry I didnt show it betterwhen I was at home.  If you ever need anything(though it may only be recieved via mail), I will be happy to help.                     Love Elder Andrews

We were invited to go to an english class at the local college so the students could hear a native speaker.  It was pretty fun and I got to teach the entire first lesson (the restoration and the Book of Mormon) to twenty seven people.  We gave out cards to recieve the Book of Mormon to all the students, so I think we might get a few lessons out of that.  We also went to the youth activity to teach the young men´s friends who play soccer with them the first lesson and three of them asked for Books of Mormon and wanted to learn more.  Then we played soccer with them.  Im not very good at soccer and it showed VERY well.  I had a good time and I think soccer is fun, so as I was watching from the side I got to know one  of the guys who was there to play.  We taght his family yesterday and they were pretty cool about it and very open to what we had to say.     At lunch on saturday the members were watching the Formula1 races at Interlagos.  Its really fascinating how it works and how fast the pit stop teams are.  The average pit stop is 5.4 seconds.  One of the drivers hit a pit worker as he was coming into the pits.  He had already slowed down so he didn´t do much besides knock him down.  The pit workers make something like 347$ per hour.  I think its interresting that the USA isolates itself from the the rest of the world in sports in that we don´t really care about soccer, we dont really care about formula one but have our own Indy 500 etc.       Well, I hope you are all doing well and love you all.              Love, Elder Andrews

It erased my letter that I slaved away writing and didn´t send it.  Im so happy.       anyway, Ill try to say the same things with out getting bored with redundance.  I got Anna´s letter on wednesday, the postal service just ended a strike last week so I don´t know how long it took to get here but I sent out a bunch of letters today, among which were some for Charles, Grandma Woodbury, Erin(which has letters for Morgan and Anna in it too) and to Aurelia as well.  They should arrive in approximately sixteen days, so be patient. I have decided to hate car alarms for the rest of my days, because every where you go you hear them, and they will go on for hours at a time as I learned in church as I listened to two car alarms at contradicting pitches(diminished fifths, or C and F#).  That was fun.  I´m curious if any one can send me stephen harper´s Adress, I´d like to write him.  Transfers are coming up and we´re probably going to get another companionship in our apartment to assist us with our HUGE area.  I hope I get to stay, but we´ll see next sunday.      I enjoyed Morgans email, I really miss him and the good times we used to have.  I think it will be crazy when I get back and he will be sixteen and driving.  Maybe dating too...  I am quasi studying the compilation of the canon and  find the histories quite interresting and the words particularly covering the formation of the masoretic texts intrigue me. I seem to recall Papa (Grandpa Andrews) telling me that the old testament(exluding the Torah) was not written until around the Babylonion captivity which would prove to be interresting as to the importance of the  brass plates.  More information would be welcome.  Hint, hint, nudge, nudge.  The Bible Dictionary has been a favorite spot of mine over the past year.      Well I love you family and hope you enjoy conference this week end, I know I will.  I´m kind of jealous of Uncle Paul and Grandma Woodbury for being able t osee it live.    I suppose I´ll get to see it some day.

The next dayand every day since she has looked through the mail hopeing to get aletter back fom you. So if you get it be sure and acknowledge it'sreceipt in your email and then mail a letter when you can. She willappreciate it to no end. She as well as the rest of us remember you inour prayers and pray for the Lord to help you be humble and safe.The weather has been fairly warm here this week but the nights havecooled down nicely so that the weather has been very tolerable. We gotrain on Tuesday which has helped the grass and weeds. Currently there isthunder in the distance and it was raining when we got out of churchhowever we haven&#25;t gotten all that much rain.Well it hasn&#25;t been that exciting of a week around here. Morgan&#25;s heelhas continued to heal and we have changed the bandages on a regularbasis and Friday evening he and I mowed and trimmed the lawn. He put onhis tennis shoes to do the lawn and then took a shower right afterwardsand then we changed the bandages. He was no worse off for having mowedthe lawn with shoes. Today he wore the sandals that have no heal strapas he went to church. Leather shoes that are stiff may be too much. Thisweek he may even be able to participate in PE at school.Anna lost her homework packet this week. Saturday I found it wadded upin the bottom of her back pack with a bunch of other papers. She got anew packet Thursday at school and since it was due on Friday she trieddoing it Thursday night after we got back from church. She startedspending more time crying about it than doing it after she got abouthalf way through. At any rate I made her go to bed. The next morningafter some sleep (not quite enough) and a pancake (she only eats one)she was in fairly good spirits and was able to finish it. That night shewent to bed early on her own.Saturday was my first Saturday home in four weeks. We spent some timecleaning the house, it needed it pretty badly. It looked much betterwhen we got done. The rest of the day the kids wanted to be off playingwhich they did. I got a bunch of things done that I needed to do aroundthe house also.Monday and Tuesday I didn&#25;t work. I ended up staying home and doing bookwork that I haven&#25;t been able to get to all summer. It took me a whileto get through it. It rained on Tuesday and all my work is out side. Iam working on wood rot around windows still.Today in church we had a Sunday school lesson on parts of Romans and Iended up making a lot of comments many of which were contrary to thedirection of the lesson. I hope that they were helpful though I thinkErin was embarrassed to be sitting next to me. For some reason I justgot into the lesson more than I have in a while. The lesson was aboutjustification and sanctification.I sent my book to a publisher a while back ago and I got notice onSaturday that they had received it and were reviewing it. It was a formpostcard. It is nice to now that they even considered reviewing it, notthat that is such a great accomplishment as much as it is an incitementto hope.Well that may be all the news form here.LoveDad

I enjoyed zone conference and especially testimonies.  It is good to hear the testimonies of others as it helps to strengthen faith.     Elder Fontenele has been Kind of sick these past two weeks, so while he is not seriously ill, he feels less energy than I do so I have to keep up my patience and be glad that  at least I am feeling well.  I´m trying to be a happier person and smile more.  it takes alot of concentration.      Our area is great and I love the members.  our recent converts are amazing in their zeal for the church.  We had a baptism this week and it was good.

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Hello FamilyFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@sprintmail.comDate: Mon, 24 Sep 2007 21:53:10 +0000Dear family,       I got a letter from Granma Woodbury today, and I enjoyed reading it.  As I grow older and older(which is still relativley young), I gain more and more appreciation for my pregenitors and more proud of my heritage on all sides of the family.  I´m glad that some of the family will get to go to general conference in salt lake, I really want to hear that choir in person some day.        I think Dad is right that your attitude makes all the difference in your work, because even when you´re not activley doing your assigned labors, you can still be doing the mental parts of the work and influence others in a positive way.  Yesterday we were walking in a thunderstorm on the way back home( our area is reputed for being the largest in the mission and we walked for 9 Kilometers in the pouring rain) but I decided that I couldn´t get any wetter so I started ''singing in the rain'' and singing Isn´t it a lovely day to be caught in the rain.  It kept me in good spirits and my companion laughing.  Thanks Fred Astaire and Don Lockwood.        I like the topic of the book youre writing Dad, I have often commented, quite forcefully at times, the need for balance between ethics and morals and how executive decisions should be more guided by morals than ethics.  Interesting.  Also, especially in relation to the story of Joseph and Potifar´s wife based on the perspective of which guided his actions, ethics or morals?  Also, was it predetermined of premeditated what his actions\reactions would be?  Intriguing...       I have many favorite scriptures, all based on different subjects and perspectives, but universally it would be this: ''Behold a new commandment I give unto you, that ye love one another even as I loved you.  This new commandment I give unto you that ye love one another.  By this shall men know ye are My diciples, that ye love one another.''  I don´t have my scriptures on hand, so that may have some mistakes, but if there be mistakes they are of man not of God... I think the scripture reference is ST John 13:34-35.       I was teaching the first lesson one day and I noticed as we were reading the introduction, it says to read, then ponder on the MESSAGE of the Book of Mormon, and then pray.  What is the message of the Book of Mormon?  Judging by who wrote it( Mormon and Moroni) It seems good to first ask under what circumstances it was written and the style of the writers.  In nearly all places in which we recieve the interjecory narration and commentary from the authors, I see three things that display themselves, other than direct testimony of the Savior, conspicuously: First Hope, second Faith and third the fruits drawn therefrom: Charity.  See the interjections in especially in Helaman 3, Ether 12, Mormon 7 and the final chapters of the book of mormon.  This Hope, the Hope of a better world and of being clean is ''an anchor to the souls of men'' which enables them to have trust enough in the power of the atonement of Christ to excercise faith and ''try his works to do''(all of which were concieved through Charity).  I want to share my witness to the reality of the Savior and his ressurrection and Gospel in English as it helps me keep it truly real to me.      I know that Jesus Christ lives.  This is the victorious cry that I try to proclaim into darkness of despair in my actions and words.  through the atonement of Jesus Christ and our subsequent acceptance of this and HIs Gospel(Faith, Repentance, Baptism and the reciept of the gift of the Holy Ghost and the remaining Ordinances in the Temple) we can become clean, recieve his name, which I add is THE ONLY NAME GIVEN UNDER HEAVEN BY WHICH WE CAN BE SAVED, and return to our Father in Heaven to live forever with our precious loved ones, our families.  None of these things are said of habit or just the way I learned to express them, but these are what comprise my witness of Christ and my childhood of God.  I know these things.       I love you all and wish the best for you all this week.                  Love,                           Elder Andrews      PS sorry to preach, But when one is separated from family save for a few words a week in writing, your focus shifts to the most important things.

Transfers are this week but we´re both staying put and we are´nt getting another companionship until next transfer so it looks like I could stay here for another two transfers easy.  We got to go to General Conference but it was in Portuguese and they didn´t know how to put a tv up with english like they usually do for the American elders so I didn´t really understand very well.       By far the best thing that I learned was through something that happened in the middle of Joseph B Wirthlin´s talk.  He is getting weaker and therefore was trembling as he was talking, I don´t know if you all noticed, and the pulpit started to shake as well.  I was kind of worried that he might fall backward or something and I noticed President Monson in that backround and that he too was noticing this.  A few moments later, Elder Nelson came out of the dark backround and held Elder Wirthlin up and stood behind him until the end of his talk.  Elder Wirthlin didn´t make it obvious that he noticed but just kept on talking.  It really touched me that Elder Nelson stayed there, supporting his old friend with whom he has served for a long, long time.  It was charity and I could see the concern in the face of Elder Nelson and it reminded me of the way that when we need help to do what is asked of us, there is always the Savior there to hold our arm and steady our trembling selves.      Consequently, I am going to take Dad´s advice to choose something to change in our lives based on somthing we learned in conference and work on charity and doing service spontaneously.  I don´t really feel close to my companion so I´m going to try to be a good companion to influence him to have the confidence to fulfill his mission with honor.  He dosn´t particularly like to work or study, But all missionaries come out on the mission with desires to do a good job and be the best missionaries, but after a few lesser than perfect companions and some time they just don´t have the confidence or will to continue.        I personally cannot live with myself if I do not at least try to do everything possible because if I could only be out here for the time I paid for, I would be home right now, so since my family and friends are paying for me to be here and working, I owe it to you all to do the best I can.  I´m still a greenie, so I´m doing my best not to judge and learn the positive things from my senior companion, so I´m going to try to make him love and respect me through sincere service and better communication.       I´m almost positive that I already told Morgan how my study journals work, but I might repeat it especialy because it might prove helpful in his goal to follow the spirit in his life.  Like Dad said, it is helpful to write down promptings of things to do, with an area to check off the things that you´ve accomplished and to have an area to write down thoughts, memories and ispirations you have.  My study journal has never left my side for almost three years now and Ive refilled it three times already.  Maybe Ill send a photocopy of some pages to him in my next letter to him.  I also have a true study journal specially for studying and a regular journal which, I flatter myself, are well integrated and referenced in each other and in my scriptures.  I try to keep my daily journal as interesting as possible, preserving my humorous, spiritual and intellectual sides to keep it ''diverting''.  Some of my past journals are boring for me to read, so I can only imagine how boring it would be for someone else to read.  I really enjoy archiving things and organizing them.  obviously.  I love reading the scriptures, and I hope Anna learns to as well.  I tried to study the scriptures for an hour every day before my mission, and even though it was yet another hour out of my already inadaquate sleep, I noticed a significant difference in my life.  Always Pray and read the scriptures and you will never fall.  That´s something Ive learned from experience.  well, I love you all and pray for you often.  If you pray for me, ask please that I may have strength against temptations, I hope and pray that you are all blessed for your supporting me on my mission.  I love you.

It has been in the mideighties all week. We have had a south wind that has been gentle andcarried humidity up from central Texas.This week I finished up two of my window projects and got paid for themwhich has kept me afloat. Last Saturday I sent mail to Charles andAurelia. I talked to Aurelia early in the week and she had bought aticket home for Christmas and I took all her money. She wouldn&#25;t getpaid for two more weeks and so she was counting pennies and pennies thatshe didn&#25;t even have. Well one of the letters that I sent her in herpackage was unused money from financial aid. Not much but it will gether by. The package got there just in time for the weekend. GrandmaWoodbury went to Utah with her son&#25;s family (Paul). Paul&#25;s daughterlives in the same apartment complex with Nicol, another cousin. Charlesalso came down. They all went to conference I&#25;m sure and hopefully theywill write about the saga before the next week is up and I can send outcopies..We all enjoyed going to conference this week end and I challenged thekids to change something in there lives because of what they learned inconference. Anna is going to start reading more out of the scriptures.Morgan said he would try and use the Holy Ghost more in his life and Ichallenged him to write down every day what his dealings with the HolyGhost were. I told them that I was going to try and do as PresidentEyring said and try to recognized the hand of the Lord and his dealingswith me every day and write it down. I already keep a daily journal andhave for years. But I don&#25;t write a lot of personal feelings and thingslike that in it. I&#25;m going to change.Ben and I have been planning how to fix the alignment on the prob and weare going to have to replace some things. I think that we have got itlined up for later in the week. We also have a couple of things that weneed to do on the jeep. The jeep is minor stuff.Today Anna broke out her art portfolio from last year and we hung a birdin Aurelia&#25;s room from the ceiling. There is one really nice drawingthat we want to frame. I have a number of frames and she is looking forone that will do.Well we seem to be in a fairly stable mode at the moment so I don&#25;t knowif there is a lot more that I need to write about.LoveDad

He spoke ALOT and very loudly, and afterwards I wondered about things and the different religions and their truths, and if we really do have the authority of God.  They say that the signs of the gifts of the spirit follow the servants of God and the evangelicals pride themselves in having the gift of tongues.  I felt that I lacked the gift of tongues because I have such a hard time understanding anything in portuguese.  But I made and interesting discovery this week that there are two gifts of tongues, that of speaking and that of interpreting.  I know for a fact that I have been blessed with the gift of speaking in tongues due to my experiences in the CTM and my ability to teach without notes.  Also in relation to the Authority, we were at a stake wide service project and I was wondering who was in charge when I heard a young man yelling for a bunch of people to come to him and every body within the sound of his voice turned around to see what he wanted.  any one can call in a loud voice but there are certain people who kow what must happen in the great service project of life and only htey have the athourity to direct the project.  it is the same with the work of God.  we have a prophet ot direct the work of God and throw down the counterfeits of the devil.       I enjoy working with Elder fontenele and we love the area and the members love us to.       our numbers this week are:2/211/22120201152128/12

I wrote a whole letter to you all and pressed the wrong button and it erased EVERYTHING.  Thank you for sending some of the comments about my last email to me.  I´m flattered that Charles feels it to be a work of literature worthy of study in an english class.  In response to Rebecca´s comments, I wouldn´t say I have an excess of sugar but rather perhaps too much rice and beans.  It got up to 34 degrees celsius which in farenheit is HOT.       I like my new companion, he´s a little more subdued than Elder Giló was but he is a good worker.  We encountered a man from Assembly of God who felt like preaching/yelling at us for 15 minutes and didn´t give me an opportunity to utter so much as one word in reply.  I will not go into the negative aspects of his character, but suffice to say that he stopped abruptly and shook our hands and and laughed as if to show it was a pleasure, but it was more of a smug ''I confounded you'' laugh.  Just because you talk loudly and quote Isaiah and the pauline epistles, both of which it is unwise to quote authoritativly out of context, without room for interjection from the people being adressed, does not mean that you leave them confounded.  you just lose credibility thruogh lack of courtesy and loud voice.        After pondering  the experience and his doctrine which is VERY similar to ours in the use and purpose of the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, Though they deny the need of prophets and apostles after Christ (which should completly discredit the new testament), their is one major difference which makes all the difference.  We have the authority to administer in the ordinances of the Gospel and to perpetuate the priesthood through having the leadership of prophets and apostles and to continually regulate and determine doctrine and interpret the gifts and purposes of the the spirit.         Any how, i love you all and continue to pray for you all.            Love, Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Opa!From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@sprintmail.comDate: Mon, 3 Sep 2007 17:36:43 +0000Dear Family,      I got a email from Papa that somehow managed to beat my last letter in length or the lack thereof.  I laughed.  Last week we had two baptisms, and three days later Elder Giló was transferred.  I´m sad, the members are sad and the secretary office is pleased with the new secrtary to the president, Elder Giló.  He gets to do President´s dirty work for six months.  Lucky him.       We used to have six umbrellas in the apartment, but apparently they were all elder gilós, so when it rained on friday, there was a broken down black one and a grey one in the kitchen as well.  I kindly let Elder Fontenelle use the black one and quickly learned some things about the grey one.        Most of the umbrellas here form a perfect upside down U or bowl shape.  This grey one however followed a flat plane peaking and decending in the middle.  While these features drew the mind of teh beholder to the designs in architecture furniture and art of the far east, I found that the most intriguing feature of this ''guarda-chuva'' was the designers apparent zeal for interior design.  the observer of the missionary in possesion of teh said umbrella might think  ''that missionary has a grey umbrella which i call peculiar in design.''      however there is more to grey, small, simple, and seemingly drab umbrella than meets the eye.  from the book of JL Andrews vol. one we read about this humble haven to the creature we call man from teh pounding precipitation;     ''Behold I looked into the heavens and gazed into the firmament above my head and lo, a whit wheel filled as it were with purple pimpernels and also the wheel was encircled about with crimson and also after this the white and flowers continuing; and while in the midst of tehis vision of glory, I beheld and percieved that my companion laughed, and behold the heavens were wroth and the rain descended upon him htat he was wet.''      THere are many interpretations of this passage, some of which have drawn on the 'colorfulness' of speach to be interpreted as such preposterous Ideas as a prophecy concerning Icew cream having no bones; a vision of Elvis wearing Mickey mouse ears; or even past generals of Czechoslavakia, all of which are so positivley revolting in their puerile inconsistency.  that we may well presume these to ve the fictitiousimaginations of seekers of fame based on preumed perception of ancient scripture.  we dismiss  all such inventions with ignominious injunction of ignorant infantile egostism.      What we gather from this explicit thouugh rather colorful account through practical analysis is the unique nature of havcing a white circle filled with flowers (probably Lavender, as is included in the footnotes and various commentary from such authorities as Jose Andreas guieseppi andreasini and mickail Ivanovitch) with a large portion of red circling this with a border simulating  design of the center.  Also a warning against making fun of others.      WE also encountered an evangelical preacher whose Right eye wandered and shouted loud enough to drown out ......alot.     well, I love you all and wish he best to you.   love Elder Andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Hi FamilyFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@sprintmail.comDate: Mon, 20 Aug 2007 20:41:19 +0000Dear Family,      Thank you for the letters this week.  I especially appreciate the advice on getting along with my companion.  Though my companion is practically perfect in every way, I´m sure I won´t always be so lucky in my companions so I´m going to preserve the advice for the rest of my mission and perhaps you should save that letter as I may ask for it again and again in life.  We had zone conference this week and I had a good time.  I have commented to the President several times In my letters that Elder Giló sets up commitments perfectly and ''seamlessly'', so president Dansie asked us to give a demonstration of this ''seamless'' commitment for the four zones present.  He also gave permission to Elder Giló to kill me afterwards for having such a big mouth.        I got a letter from Grandma Woodbury in which she mentioned the importance of keeping the sabbath day holy.  If one looks at the order of the creation in the scriptures, you can notice a symbolism of Important events correlating with the seven millenia that have transpired starting with the fall ending with the sanctification of the earth and setting of man to rule on the earth in righteousness.  This became apparent to me when I went to the temple and noted that the creation is listed in different order.  If you watch for the number seven and ask why that number, such as in the case of the story of Naaman and you will start to see things.  There have been seven Major dispensations since the fall; Adam, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Moses, the primitive church, and the dispensation of the fullness of times(now).  after being immersed in these seven dispensations, man kind will be clean.  Also it will be worthy of note that the prophet did not see him in person but his servant told him what to do.  Mooey interasontey...       I love you all very much, especially Dd. And Aurelia. And Morgan.  And Anna.  And as I think about it, ''I love you all individually with affection un bounded and unmeasued in this world.  But collectivley...''      Have a good week family and read the scriptures and pray every day in the name of the LORD.                            Elder Andrews

Sounds like the summer is finally winding down.  So morgan  had to get a new suit huh?  I sometimes wonder how tall he will ve when I get back.  It always seems that i forget what i was going to write when I sit down to email, so this may get pretty random. today we went to a members house to watch movies and do service.  our district leaders were in our area today to pass pday with us so they helped.  Elder hall´s companion elder Rodriguez mowed the lawn and I had to hold the extension cord.  I don´t think he´s ever mowed a lawn before.  I must have OCD or something because I actually sang hymns to keep myself from screaming.  When I mow, aerate vacuum etc., I make a pattern to follow involving STRAIGHT lines, so the random fan pattern and weird bent lines enraged my soul and my eyes were probably glowing neon red... This week we accomplished our 7 goals yet again, at the price of being out a little later than recommended.  We would have been home on time, but we had six contacts to make and we were in a members car on the way home when we saw 4 people in the street so we had the member drop us of fifty feet away and we made tyhe contacts and searched for two people(we ended up finding two people a block away from our apartment in a parked car) and finished to find the district leader had been waiting for us at our apartment for an hour.  Fun.       My companion is excellent.  His Dad died out of the blue on Saturday and he´s been handling it perfectly.  When Mom died I wasn´t supposed to work for a week but after the family left I felt like I would go out of my mind if I didn´t do something so I went back to work.  I think Elder Giló is the same way.  we worked really hard on sunday.  well we watched fantastic four 2 and harry potter 5 on DVD today.  Neither of them has left the theaters yet but this is Brazil.  I have yet to see a legitamate copy of any dvd or CD.         Os morros aqui no Brasil são muito grande e minhas pernas estão com fogo.  Esta semana foi difícil.  Some of you may ask if you were supposed to understand any of that, to which I would say; "No.  I just wanted you to know haw hard it was"        I love you all and wish the best for you.

Again I apologize that Ididn't get lasst weeks letter to you on time. SOme of your siblings haveor are continuing to write to you snail mail. We remember you in ourprayers and hope that all is well with you.It is Sunday afternoon and I just woke up from a to hour nap and I feelgroggy and not much like doing anything. I hate taking longer naps. Atany rate the weather here has been in the 90's all week with highhumidity and a chance of morning rain for the first three days of theweek. I believe we got some rain on Tuesday evening. So far our weatherpatterns have been quite mild for the last month. Some times we getdumped on but not that much thunder and lightning and the winds havebeen very light. It is supposed to be even warmer this coming week.It has been a typical week for me as far as work goes. Charles workedwith me for several days and then I let him work on his car and getpacked to go. By the end of the week I was almost done with the framingand plumbing of the bathroom. I found out that I needed to run three waywire for the fire alarms instead of two way wire so I need to re dothat. Most of the wiring is accessible still so it won&#25;t be such aterrible thing just aggravating. Thursday we got an emergency call froma longstanding customer. They had problems at both their houses and sowe went and tried to solve them. One house they are having problems withthe refrigerator freezer and the laundry drain turned out to be halfclogged. I fixed the clog but the freezer is out of my league. At theother house they had a flooding problem in the basement and thought thatit was the sump pump but I don&#25;t think so. We rearrange the sump pumpand it seems to be working ok. They had some real good rain on Tuesdayevening in their part of town. Wednesday evening I took the scoutsswimming at a pool in one of their housing divisions. Had some veryunusual cloud formations that evening. There were two strips of cloudsin a generally cloudy sky that ran from one horizon to the other. Thestrips originated from one point on the horizon and spread out over headand then converged to a single point at the other horizon. Kind of aparallel line visual distortion due to distance as the lines followed aspherical curvature. The lines were lit up like the sun was shiningthrough them. Never seen anything like it.This week Brent has been at the Chiefs training camp in Wisconsin doinghis rotation on the IT staff. Nicole and her four kids came up to staywith Erin while Brent was gone. Nicole is an old friend of Erin&#25;s whonow lives in Austin Texas. Erin also came down with walking pneumoniathis week and it has taken a little bit of a toll on her.Charles replaced the drivers side drive axile on his Accura thisThursday evening. By the time he was done he was covered from head tofoot with grease. It is the fourth time he has replaced it. It is oldhat by now but never real easy. Friday late he left for Ruth&#25;s and spentSaturday with her family having fun. I believe that to day he is on theroad to my mothers place. It is actually forty five minutes closer toBellefountaine from her house than from ours. He was going to stop atCatherine&#25;s, in Clarksville, on the way but Catherine and kids are inAugusta Georgia this week with Noah. I talked to Charles a few minutesago and he is still at Ruth&#25;s and will leave early in the morning for Ohio.Morgan and Anna have played with friends and had a good time this weekand enjoyed their last full week of vacation. Anna got to go bowlingwith a friend last night. She enjoyed it. Morgan and I went to seminaryregistration and his teacher will be one of Laura&#25;s girl friend&#25;shusbands. He married Brandy Gaughn. He will start seminary two Mondaysfrom tomorrow. Anna and I went over to the school today and her teacherwill be Mrs. Pitner. She was new last year but Anna knows who she is andis excited to be going back to school. Anna is singing church hymnstonight with Aurelia accompanying her on the piano. She is taking aninterest in music and sometimes sings to herself in her room.Aurelia is working lots now. They dismissed four temps and two othersquit. So now she has lots of work. Thursday she went in late. She didn&#25;tdo the dishes like she said she would when she got home and she neededto fill out her pell grant application. She did the application on linebut she got to work about an hour and a half late.Well that is most of the news from here.LoveDad

Elder Giló decided not to kill me.       As I have been studying Isaiah, I have begun to see what a priveledge it is to be an elder in Israel.  When I first got my call I was gratefull to be able to be part of the fulfilling of promises made to the prophets of the Book of Mormon and a part of the gathering of Israel.   Isaiah ties in well with the Symbolism in the story of Joseph in Egypt as well.      Elder Giló and I get along well and I try to learn as much as possible in the way he teaches, the way he talks to everybody and especially the way he treats everybody as a friend.  He never gives up when we have more to do and he really cares about the people we teach and have taught.  He also cares a great deal about the members and they are affected very positivley by his friendship.  His presence is not only good for the investigators, but for the members as well.  And he is very merciful in not killing me after zine conference.  We both laughed about that afterwards.      Our area is great and we have wonderful investigators and though it can be difficult to get them to change, if you can find the problem it can be very simple to get them to keep commitments especially if you help them and give them someone to trust and develop faith to act.  Missionary work may be hard, but if you just accept it and get to work, it becomes your way of life and its easier.      Our numbers this week are as follows0014/48111060/0155140/0

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: Criciúama 1From: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: mp8-dansie@ldsmail.netDate: Mon, 27 Aug 2007 21:01:05 +0000Elder AndrewsElder GilóCriciúma 1Zone TuberãoDear President Dansie,        This week was well.  We had two baptisms who were wonderfull.  I remembered that you had said it was likely that Elder Giló would be transferred, so I have prepared to be able to show a new person around but more especially, I have been paying attention to the way he treats investigators and members alike, and I have most observed that the thing which makes him effective is his love for them which so shown in his every action and conversation.  While we teaching an investigator about prayer and scripture study this week I remembered something that president Cardon told us to be effective; Get close to the Savior and stay there.  It occurred to me that the way we do this is to pray in the name of the Savior every day and feast on the words of christ every day as well.  The council of the prophets is always the same: pray, read the scriptures and keep the commandments.  The things that qualify us for ''the work'' are Faith, Hope, Charity and Love with and eye single to the Glory of God.  These are the things that help us to ''know thee and Jesus Christ whom Thou hast sent''.  These are the things that lead us to Eternal Life.  It takes Faith in Jesus Christ to pray in His name and fulfill the At-one-ment of us to God through being one with the Savior to speak to the Father.  All other attributes are stems from our knowing of the Savior and Father, this helps us to change our desires and become more like him.  I love the Gospel of Jesus Christ and how real it is the more you ponder upon it.       Elder Giló is Amazing.  Thank you for letting us be companions in my first transfer.  I am sad he is leaving, but we all have things to do in our times.  I just remember hte parable in section 88 in the doctrine and covenants.  tudo bem.       Our area is excellent, the members love us and I love to sing to them at almoso and strengthen them.  We have a family that isn´t golden, but platinum.  they want ot be baptized before they go to spain in ttree weeks so we have to work fast.  We also have a group of friends who are doing well if we can get them to come to church on their own.        The things that came to me when we were teaching I taught in a bit easier way to understand and I think the investigators took it well.  I feel that if they can pray to their Father in Heaven they will recieve their own testimony.  they may say that they prayed, but I want tehm to Truly pray.Our numbers this week;2212/5121960115290/10

It went well, I really like the way he dosnt beat around the bush at all.       One day when we were at lunch I was telling a story from the CTM about pancakes and got the word mexar(to mix) and mijar(to pee) mixed up and said that I peed syrup.  Yeah.       I don´t have very much time this week to write, but I want you all to know that I love you and am very gratefull for the letter you all wrote at the family reunion.  It was great.     I love you all.               Love Elder Andrews

My companion and I get along very well, and I find that I learn more and more from his methods of teaching and how well he sets up his commitments and challenges.  I love and look up to him.      Our work moves on, we work hard and find and teach many people.  we have several progressing investigators and some new investigators which have great potential as their hearts are open.  the members are friendly and love us very much.       This week went well despite the rain and other less than favorable weather.  It seems that each time it rains, we find someone that is waiting for us.  This was the case on Thursday, friday and saturday.  Particularly on saturday when we found a family that was perfect and the mother had searched for the truth and was still ready to recieve the truth.  Her son said that he was going to spain in a couple of weeks and asked if we had a church their and if so he would get baptized there if he had to.  It was remarkable because we were trying to find there house(it was a referral for the gospel blesses families booklet) and it was dark and raining, but we kept going.  It was just like President Faust said about the extra mile hours that we keep going and get the rewarding moments of life.Our number this week:0016/5411350/3174140/15          God Bless and thank you for the work you do for us.

Studying Isaiah is nice when you study it determinedly, it keeps all the events in context.  In the Bible dictionary it says that as you read the Book of Mormon and Doctrinte and Covenants, you will understand Isaiah better.  I think that that is true.  The Book of Mormon talks so much about the house of Israel and its focus is on the fulfillment of the abrahamic covenant.  When I recieved my call to FLorianópolis, it made me happy to be able to help fulfill the promises of the Lord to those who wrote the Book of Mormon, and help restore the decendants of those who have passed on to recieve the Gospel.        My Area is excellent.  I really find that the members are great.         I love elder Giló, he is an excellent example and remind me of my brother who is an excellent man.         Thank you for all you do for us and I look forward to Interviews on wednesday.                         Sincerely, Elder Andrews

He is excellent in his devotion to the Lords work.  I grow evrery time that we teach together and I am trying to emulate his ways of teaching without seams and setting up commitments naturally.  I love the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the truths that are taught through the basic principles and ordinances alone.  Every time I ponder on it, my testimony of our childhood of God grows.       Elder Giló is doing well outwardly in taking the death of his Father, and I try to help him be positive and help him to keep his thoughts off of the negative aspects of what has happened, but to my joy, I find that he already does this!  He is perfect.  When my mom died I found that it was best to work and continue with life and let her memory live on without pain of death but the joy of life.  I think Elder Giló is similarly inclined.  we have continued to work hard and once again, thank you for the opportunity to serve with him.      Our area is I love the members and enjoy sharing the spirit of the work with them.  I really like our area and am trying to remember everything so | can be prepared to show someone else around if and when necessary.      Our numbers this week are:0/017/5421850/3173140/3

My companion is very supportive and helping.  It seems that the main qualification of a trainer is to be able to teach lessons in full with a little input from someone that has a hard time speaking.  I love to teach however and even though I can´t speak but a few sentences on many subjects, when I teach with desire to convey the importance of a special subject or priciple, the spirit takes over.  I am very grateful to bea able to teach not with words, but with the spirit.  I love the Lord and enjoy doing his work.       I love Elder Giló as he is a hard worker and very supportive.  We get along well, we work hard and he always knows what we are doing.  We pray together and bear testimony to each other.  It is good to be with one so positive.       I really like the members here, they are very generous and willing to assist us and the people of Criciúma are wonderful.  It amazes me how open about they are about their feelings.  We have a few investigators that are doing well, and I hope we are able to solve their concerns as they come up when we teach the commandments.  Brasil is Beautiful.       My first night here we shared a brief message about the plan of salvation with the boyfriend of a sister we are teaching.  He interrupted to say that he was having feelings concerning our way of teaching that he never had had and wanted us to come over on sunday to eat italian food and teach him more.  Two other investigators shared their testimonies with us about the truth of the book of mormon and the church without us asking and they are both marked for baptism.  I love the opportunity to serve the Lord through serving his children and wish to do the best I can.thank you for everything you do for us and God bless.

And that was a huge email that dad sent.  I really had a good time recalling the things that dad does to keep the van running.  i remember the time when he took off the engine cover and had a paint dip stick in some part or other and when the van wouldnt work right, he would jiggle it.  one time it spit fire back at him.  Or the time when we drove to the east coast on something like 4 cylinders...       I´m glad that the family adventures went well.  i´m not particularly impressed with the flying in brasil, as we waited on the runway for an hour in São Paulo and a couple of hours later a plane flew off the runway.  Its kind of strange to think that that could have been me.  all in all i´m glad to have gotten to Floripa safely.  it´s beautiful here.  São Paulo was extremely feio (ugly) because Every thing is concrete.      We were all right in supposing that the CTM is mini america.  In Criciúma we don´t have hot water or washing machines so shaving and washing the dishes are less than favorable experiences in the mornings when its roughly forty degrees.  But I really like it here.  we have a ward and the Irmãs-sisters feed us ALOT.  if i eat three plates of beans and rice, they think i don´t like their food.  I eat lunch with them and i don´t eat dinner and i´m not hungry when I go to bed.  my new companion Elder Giló is cool, he has a great sense of humor and is very supportive of my português.  Its really hard to teach, but the the spirit takes over and covers up my very limited português.       I didn´t know that dad was writing a book!  Thats really cool.  I hope the new Harry Potter book is good.  I find i don´t care much for the attitudes of the main characters in the recent books.  there are alot of hills here and my legs burn alot so hopefully I won´t gain weight from all the arroz e fejão.         sounds like aurelia is tearing up the town in Olathe.  Boys, music, -all she needs now are some guys in huge basketball jerseys on the street corner selling mountain dew and a bentley and she could rule the city.  just kidding.  which quintett is she playing? Dvorák?  sounds cool.  well my time is expired so take care and know that I love you.  tell Grandma thatnk you for teh email, I was just studying section 138 a few weeks ago and dispelled some false docrtine that someone told me.  it´s a marvelous chapter with the book of moses.              Love Elder Andrews

Learning is good, but you can only prepare for something for so long before you feel like its time to act.  All the brazileiros can understand me just fine, but it may take some time before I can understand them.        I hope you all had a great time at the family reuinion.  I know I always love to go to them.  I was reading the conference issue of the ensign with my companion and i decided to read the article by Elder holland.  I think it would be a good idea for the family to read it and try to focus on how we can be positive in our speech to each other and build each other up.        We went proselyting on friday of last week and had an excellent time.  I really enjoyed bearing testimony with great sincerity to the people and could tell they could feel the love of god in the things i said.  it was really cool because i was just talking about the restoration gospel  and plan of salvation without any memorization.       The executive secretary to the CTM presidency, Elder Smith, and I have become music friends.  He served a mission in brazil in 1961, and was released from proselyting to tour all of brazil on a musical mission.  he has some sweet stories and is going to burn a copy of his vocal quartett and i will let him have a copy of our cd that we made just before i left.  I dont think that hes getting a fair trade, but im exited.         President Monson said that if we memorize a verse from the book of mormon every day for a year, we will have a photographic memory, so guess what im doing?  even if wouldn´t work, its a good thing to do.I love you all and pray for you often.

I am always so gratefull for your receptiveness to the promptings of the spirit.  Last december when i stopped through Denver and stayed the night, you asked me if I could use a blessing and I DID.  that blessing gave me the strength I needed and I thank you for asking me if I needed it.  I also appreciate your prayers, I´m afraid that I need them!        Every one on the fourth floor of the CTM is always humming I See Our Zion because I sing it every night in the showers.  Do think it would be possible for you to send me a copy of the music via email?  My District wants to sing it in church.  If not, I will completely understand.  Copy rights are tricky sometimes and email too.        I appreciate Paul Paul´s comments that were included in the email.  That was pretty fun that night after Nacho Libre.  I truly love being with the woodburys for whatever reason.  wherever the family is, there the spirit is also.  More especially when we sing.  I am going to miss that for the next two years.                                 God Bless you all,                                                      Elder Andrews-----Original Message-----From: "Paul Woodbury" &lt;pwoodbu@mstar.net&gt;To: &lt;jakaal@myldsmail.net&gt;Date: Sun, 17 Jun 2007 22:14:36 -0600Dear Joseph,I have been thinking about you often and I am so pleased you are serving the Lord on a mission. I hope you are doing well and learning the language as you prepare to serve.I know you will be a great missionary as you are diligent. You have such a natural way with people and so many enjoy being with you. I was in our Young Singles Ward and a group of Young Singles came up and told me about your talk and song in the Singles ward there. I think I am related to a celebrity, with all the fans you have in Colorado!Joseph, I know that your Mother is watching over you as you serve. She is the main reason I am writing, - I just keep hearing her say I should write to you. Serving this mission is the best thing you can do, and as you are faithful and obedient, this mission will be a hallmark experience for you and you will be protected and have great success.We are excited to be with your family in 2 weeks as we have a reunion in Colorado with the family. We pray for you and wish the Lord's choicest blessings upon you as you serve.We Love you!Uncle Paul WoodburyDear Joseph,We all miss you alot and whenever we watch Barbie Princess and the Pauper we can't help thinking of you. I am so happy for you and your decision to serve a mission. You are so cool. I'm going to miss singing with you at the next family reunion, adn I'm going to miss running out of gas in the middle of the night in the middle of nowhere with a smoking engine and having Julia come rescue us. I hope you are enjoying your mission. Love Paul Paul.

This last week has been pretty good, we learned the subjunctive tenses in poruguese and it went pretty much over my head.  I can teach pretty well in portuguese, if I can't say what I want i can always reword it in a way that i know how to express in the language.  I sang I see our zion for all the american missionaries on saturday, it was alot of fun.      I think you are all at or onthe way back from or whatever, from the family reunion.  I hope you are having/had a good time.  I love getting together with the woodburys.  they have such a special spirit and I love to sing with them.  be sure to sing that one song that paul julia dan and i got to sing before thanksgiving last year.  awake and sing or whatever.  it was pretty much sweet.      I only have two weeks left to go here at the CTM, so time is winding down.  we are the old ones at the CTM now so we can make weird traditions and everything for the new elders.     one night last week, i had a dream about the family at a reuniion or somthing and i felt a good deal of concern for you all.  I woke up with tears on my face and prayed for you.  I don't know if any thing was wrong, but i want you to know that i do pray for you every day.  i love you all very much and i appreciate the letterS from aurelia.  it was kind of interesting to get three letters form her on the same day.  im sending a letter to her today and it will probably take 3 weeks to get there.  I hope that everything goes well with the Skyler thing.  sounds AwkwAaAard!  same with the whole situation with charles' ex-girlfriend.  I'm glad I dont have to worry about those kind of things.  I'll bet morgan is thinking of investing in a bat or somthing to keep off the ladies too.  I hear that braces quadruple the ability to sweet talk in junior high...      Happy birthday to charles tomorrow!  you'll have to tell me what kind of cake you have.  I have sadly discovered that the Brasileiros don't realy specialize in or take delight in cookies, ice cream, sweets or any other manner of deliciousness which is fot the joy of mankind.  they do have paçoca though, which is like powdered peanut butter.  its more or less scrumptuously-delightful.      Ive made a few discoveries in the book of mormon these past few weeks.  I once had a home teaching companion tell me that we couldn´t repent or change after this life because of what it says in alma's letter to corianton in alma 46ish and it made me mad.  we are still people and to say  that we cannot change demeaned and denied the power of the atonement so i studied.  result- we can change and repent in the spirit world, and after the ressurrecion, we are made to permanantly as we are at the time of the resurrection.       Also, as i was reading in alma 32 i read verse 40 and asked the question: do we plant our own tree of life through our heed to the word?  I had always supposed that the seed spoken of was faith, but on colser analysis, it says the word is the seed.  furthermore, in the folowing chapters when amulek speaks, he makes reference to the word bein in christ which references John 1:1-15.  some food for study if any one wants to take the time.      well i love you all and hope to hear from you next week                Love,                        Elder andrews

[jakaalhide_hotmail.com]--Forwarded Message Attachment--Subject: hello familyFrom: jakaal@myldsmail.netTo: skipandrews@sprintmail.comDate: Tue, 19 Jun 2007 18:11:11 +0000Dear família,it was good to get your emails this week.  i appreciate you sending last weeks letter.  Even if I didnt  get it until this week I am glad to know that you still think of me.  every thing is going pretty well here at the CTM, although earlier this week most of my district was having issues with my companion elder cornaby.  he´s young and has never ventured out of clinton utah and it apparently shows.  they asked me to talk with him about his attitude.  We were giving our concerns about one of our teacher´s capabilities with teaching as she is not perfect in english, when he raised his hand to say that he didn´t have any problems with her teaching at all whatsoever.  the rest of the district got a little upset that he made their concerns look more like murmuring and they asked me to talk to him.  i prayed alot that night.  So I talked to him in a general way and taght him about the attitude we should have as missionaries based on D&amp;C 5:4- namely charity, and everything turned out fine.  I firmly believe their are two basic facets to obedience.  first, obedience to the commandments, which my companion, and most of the district does well, and more importantly, to obey the governing principles of the law.  if you can obey the principles, you can discern when it is appropriate to use the spirit of the law as opposed to the letter of the law.  whenever you follow the spirit of the law, you go to a higher point in the law, NEVER to break the law.  unfortunatley, most people don`t recognize this and i think this is the reason we have a in-finite number of law in the US to specify when it counts or not.           any way, i´d rather have an uber obedient companion than an undermotivated and disobedient companion.  Contrary to popular belief i do have to do my own laundry.  I have to admit its alot easier to do when you only have seven outfits to wash.          i am glad to hear that work is going well for dad and ben and that the RX-7 is up and running for Aurelia.  Who needs boys when you have an RX-7?  I´ll never forget the time when she came over to Erins house to get butter because Charles forgot to get some.  I´ve never seen something as funny as her backing out of the drive way and TEARING off like cruella de-ville.  I think it suffices to say she was RAGING MAD.  It´s really funny to think back on.           i am glad to hear that ashton adam and chloe are in town.  i miss all my neices and nephews.  sounds like anna is having fun with soccer and i am glad.  i really miss her and morgan.  i hope they are getting along with each other.  I am glad that morgan also wants to get his patriarchal blessing.  i wish i could have been ther when he got it.           well i have to go soon so happy father´s day(a couple of day´s late) to Dad.  I know it may not have ever seemed like it, but i do Thank you for your patience with me and letting me work with you when i couldn´t find a job.  That was probably the hardest time of my life starting when Mom died through May of 2006.  but fortunately i recieved answers and peace in my life last summer that allowed me to press on with hope for my future.  I know that the Power of the ressurection is real, that we can gain a forgivness of our sins through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ and that as we gain faith in him, we will see the sun, the fowers adn the trees, and we will see the light of the TRUTH:  All these things exist for the express purpose of our attaining the bithright of GODhood, for this is the work and the  glory of GODs; to bring to pass the maturity of their children.         Love Elder Andrewsi see our zion and family history fathers day and brents b day

THEY actually pronounce everything.        i hope you are able to get a good screen for the computer.  any thing smaller than the one we had would probably seem horrendously undersized.  though i bet you wont miss the blinking colors.  my companion and i are getting along quite well.  the other day after i hade made some joke or other right before he said the distrito oração.  we were all a little tired and slightly on edge and he said "nós Te agradecemos por meu companihero, Elder Andrews..." and elder pierringer lost it.  he said it in plural form and singular and was very specific.  hes a good guy.  he still has a gringo accent, especially when he says das verdages.  it always reminds me of charles´ el hombre gordo está comiendo la carne e la manzana grande e la casa piquenã.        i am so glad to be able to go to the temple every week.  it is wonderful. eu gosto muito!  this was the last week that we get to go to the campinas temple.  ill miss it veruy much, the palm trees are huge.  next week untill the end of our stay in the ctm we will be going to the são paulo temple.  every one says that the campinas temple is prettier on the outside but saõ paulo is prettier on the inside.  im excited.       i love you all aand wish the best for you.  i hope morgan and anna are ready fot the summer.  maybe morgan can start dance lessons...    im a misionary and im ok,   i sleep all night and i study all day   i have been learning the gospel,   ive been eating rice and beans,   and now that ive done my milestones,   ill go eat rice and beans again!   im a missionary and im ok,   i sleep night and i study all day.   since i arrived at the mtc,   ive been learning portugese.   i m a missionary and im ok,   i sleep allnight and i study all day!       -Elder Andrews

Igot a little carried away and spoke of baptism and what my baptism means to me and then i asked irmã melo if she wanted to be baptized.  SHE SAID YES!         it will be a little harder than that when im talking to an actual pesquisador, but it was cool because i got a feel of what its like to follow what the spirit tell us to do as we teach the lessons.  needless to say we passed the first milestone with flying colors.         during mdst on thursday, someone commented on the excellence of our district and how none of us were overwhelmed by homesickness because we all treat each other like family and we love each other.  that led to an unofficial testimony meeting where all of us bore testimony of our calling and pupose not only in Brazil, but in our lives.    then we finished with a community prayer where each of us took turns saying a short prayer.  we went through the whole district and finished with me.  we all came away alot stronger from that nights mdst, even though we didnt learn any portugês.         its hard to come away from an experience like that and have to chasten people in the district for disturbing study time or breaking small rules, but fortunatly they love me enough to understand that im not just trying to excercise power.           my district threw a birthday party for me with coonkies and superman cards and everything.  the mission presdidents wife, sister cardon, bought me a HORRENDOUSLY LARGE box of candy and irmã melo bought me some cookies.  it was a good day.        you guys make it sound like morgan had to leave the dance at youth conference because he was afraid, but I know the truth:  there were too many babes after him and he had to escape from the throngs of fans that were stifling his handsomeness.  its true.          i did get papas letter as well as grandma Zahller and grandma Woodbury as well.          president cardon is renting a cello for me to play while at the CTM so i am muito animado porque.  dad i dont think you would be poor for granite jobs down here.  every one and their dogs fleas have granite couter tops or floors etc.  the campinas templo celestial room is filled with marble crown moulding, arches over the doors and from the floor up tree feet to the chair guard.          i got aurelias letter and i will reply by post.  it takes longer but its specialer...          I love you all and wish the best for you.                           Love                                  Elder Andrews.

We had the area president of the church for south brasil come in to adress us in tuesdays fireside.  he spoke a great deal on studying the scriptures and keeping a study journal.  apparently a few days ago he spent about five hours studying first nephi one verse one.  everyone in my distrito gave me the thumbs up when he mentioned study journals.  i have had two for some time: one for meetings and epiphanes and one strictly for scripture study.  my scriptures study journal has a forward to the reader, a table of contents, and a guide for whomever it comes to on how to differentiate the sections on each page for notes, revelations and impressions and promptings.         the secretary of the ctm is renting a cello for me to play.  it´s my birthday present to me- i´m so happy...        í´ve worked up quite the reputation for ipersonationg people, especially Irmã Paçanha, the james earl jones of brazil.  he always tells us to `be carefull´  i guess youd have to be there to appreciate it.       last night in mdst (missionary directed study time which every one hurts my ear through redundance by saying ´mdst time`) we had the windows cracked and four bees flew in to our distritos class room and elder Pierringer and i lured them out of the flourecant lights and killed them  with our notebooks.  i layed some pretty heavy smack down on the bees.  suffice it to say that i have earned and retained my alias of superman.( EVERYBODY down here thinks i look just like clark kent)        i think its hilarious that bogrid, aka xerox, got to take a bag of ground up white stuff to school with him(advil).  i hope he didnt get interrogated.  im glad to hear that dad has work too.  i assume the windows and doors you mentioned were at someones house that you were working at.    well im out of time, im a slow (and not very proficient) typer so my forty five minutos has expired.        I love you all dearly and pray for every day                                       elder andrews

Love Elder Andrews   ps i would appreciate it if you could forward this letter and adress to the family.
