# Execution Plan
I need to follow a plan for getting a book published. So far, I will need to

1. Determine who it's written for
2. Determine what they need
3. Determine my story to help them
4. Assemble story candidates
5. *Rough* Draft stories
6. Verify stories with my companions
7. Once confirmed, polish stories
8. Alpha/Beta Readers
9. Publish/Find agent, then publish

## Determine Target Audience

## Central Message/Thesis - Orders: After the Son of God
This is a five-second moment (Story Worthy). Candidates:
- Silvino - My greatest regret
- Salete (Agronomica) - A ministry fulfilled

### Sub Concept One
The Ministry of Angels is literal, not just pretty words. Story of Salete (Uniao da vitoria) and the ministry of angels

### Sub Concept Two
God gives his power to those who do his work for others, not themselves
- Casting out devils
- Tati's family and our teaching blind
- Elder Brough speaking in tongues
- Teaching in the Paulista
- Teaching Irene's boyfriend

### Sub Concept Three
Miracles are in response to Faith in Jesus Christ
- Elder Gilo told me about greenie faith. I witnessed this in Itajai
- Elder Silva and casting out a devil

### Experiences

First night with Elder Giló - walking out under the stars after a lesson and feeling on fire

Elder Pimentel showing up and things just _happening_.

Elder Coburn as a conduit of God's love

Borrowing money from the bartender to get busfare in Uniao da Vitoria - that lesson was powerful

The realization that if everyone who had believed had been baptized, I would have baptized hundreds, possibly thousands

Loucuras - preaching on the bus and in the bus station, and what we saw

Casting a devil out with elder Silva

Tati - she was allowed to be baptized

Luciane - querem entrar?

Offset fasting for a new branch president in Uniao da Vittoria

Preaching in the Paulista
