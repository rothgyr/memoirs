# To Be a Priest
## Writing Tenets
A story should still be compelling, even if it's a real story. We will need to begin writing with these things in mind, both at a story level, and at
a scene level:
* Thesis
* Wanting _A_ without having to _B_
* Scene|Sequel

Each chapter could follow this rhythm:

1. The Principle: “Faith is a choice before it’s a feeling.”

2. The Story: A moment from your mission where you had to act in faith before you felt it—maybe a prompting to speak to someone, or a prayer answered in an unexpected way.

3. The Breakdown: What you learned, how it tested you, how it changed you.

4. The Invitation: A reflection or challenge for the reader—how they can apply this principle in their own life.

## Thesis & Themes
I believe my thesis should be based around the themes of becoming a priest.

## Outline
### Forward
An answer to secularization

### Part One: A Journey to Priesthood
1. My Journey to Receive a Call
2. Faith to Be Healed
3. A Pilgrim and a Wanderer
4. Loved for Who You Are, not in Spite of Who You Are
5. Endowed with Power from on High

### Part Two: Power in the Priesthood


## Examples

Prologue:
Importance of arriving prepared. Illustrate my preparation with regards to

* Remaining faithful while mourning my losses
* Working through masturbation with Bishop Reynolds
* Study

Yeesh. This could be its own book section, and maybe should be... There are certainly
three chapters' worth of content here.

MTC and Cornaby:
Have a thesis of what I learned in my time at the MTC, and from Elder Cornaby.
Tell stories, each of which illustrates this? For instance, my time at the MTC would
be to learn to teach with power - all kinds of stories about prayer, working as a team,
learning, etc., culminating with the story of our third excursion to the Paulista and
what I was able to accomplish there.

Gilo and Criciúma:
Have a thesis about faith, and trusting in God. Tell stories, most of them
illustrating being blessed for our trust in God, culminating in some story that shows
what happened as a result - probably Tatiana's baptism or something. Recapitulate the
thesis.
