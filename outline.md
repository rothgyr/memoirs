# Outline

## Writing Tenets
A story should still be compelling, even if it's a real story.

We will need to begin writing with these things in mind, both at a story level, and at 
a scene level:

* Thesis
* Wanting _A_ without having to _B_
* Scene|Sequel


## Examples
Prologue:
Importance of arriving prepared. Illustrate my preparation with regards to 
* Remaining faithful while mourning my losses
* Working through masturbation with Bishop Reynolds
* Study

Yeesh. This could be its own book section, and maybe should be... There are certainly 
three chapters' worth of content here.

MTC and Cornaby:
Have a thesis of what I learned in my time at the MTC, and from Elder Cornaby.
Tell stories, each of which illustrates this? For instance, my time at the MTC would 
be to learn to teach with power - all kinds of stories about prayer, working as a team,
learning, etc., culminating with the story of our third excursion to the Paulista and 
what I was able to accomplish there.

Gilo and Crici√∫ma:
Have a thesis about faith, and trusting in God. Tell stories, most of them 
illustrating being blessed for our trust in God, culminating in some story that shows 
what happened as a result - probably Tatiana's baptism or something. Recapitulate the 
thesis.
